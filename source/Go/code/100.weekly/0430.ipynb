       "'. It\\'s the best. It\\'s comfortable. He\\'s gone. The mood is shattered! It\\'s the atmosphere. It\\'s the only favorite bar in Yeonnam-dong. Okay.. Heesuya Hyosun king pork cutlet Ssangmun No.1. It was a little duhol. It\\'s a little weak. Don\\'t go. I wasted the first 10 minutes because I made a mistake in setting the box lock. I called the staff because I thought I was wrong, so I didn\\'t apologize and didn\\'t accept the setting mistake and gave them a hint I didn\\'t want. Please train the female staff. overall unfriendliness over other companies. A place where you can drink and enjoy bowling in an exciting atmosphere. I enjoyed bowling with delicious cocktails in a good atmosphere! It\\'s not cheap, but you can enjoy it as much as the price! I was stressed out at work and went with my co-workers, but all my stress went away. I want to be better at bowling. The atmosphere was good and there were many things to enjoy besides bowling. If you are waiting in the back, you should wait again. Based on one drink per person, you can\\'t even talk if it\\'s cheap, but the cheapest coke was 5,900 won. The employees are kind, but they need a change. It was my first time to see a bowling alley selling food and cocktails, and I was surprised that the quality was better than I thought. Would it be perfect to have a birthday party with your friends? The employees are kind too! Unkindness. I went to Smashing Ball for a company dinner. It was a great experience. Bowling shoes were also a wing tip; I was satisfied with the quality and the staff service.The atmosphere is so nice. The employees are also handsome and kind. I was thinking about going somewhere with my friends, and I remember going to a smashing ball in Busan, so I went in and I had a lot of fun. Thank you! It was nice to see you guys. I\\'m giving you a song request, and you told me to request the song as much as I want. While waiting, device? It was fun to do; it was comfortable because it was a sofa seat. I\\'ll be back again. It\\'s located right under Kodachaya, so it\\'s perfect for a second stop. I also sold signature beer from the bowling pin glass. I had a great time.I heard that Cheongdam store was opened, so I must go there. First of all, the store is really pretty. The staff is nice and I took my girlfriend, and I really like it. Cocktails and snacks are really pretty. It\\'s perfect for a date. I had so much fun with my friends. I thought you were in a club. I like bowling balls because they are different from other bowling places, and I like them because they are pretty because they are shoes, shoes, and shoes, but since they are a club with a song and atmosphere, it\\'s so good to drink a glass of beer and relieve stress. I\\'ll visit often. Haha. It\\'s a bit embarrassing to say it\\'s a bowling alley if you don\\'t take care of the line. There are only seven, so if there are many people, you\\'ll have to wait. It feels like a pub rather than a bowling alley. It\\'s 15,000 won per cocktail and it\\'s tasteless. It\\'s not line-managed and it\\'s not even greased. I played 4 games at the bowling center and 2 games at the price of a cup of amo, and I feel bad. I don\\'t want to waste a single star. The bowling ball and bowling alley are in bad condition. I don\\'t want to play bowling because there are scratches here and there. But the part-timers\\' service is not good and they say we have to order drinks, but the cheapest drinks are about 10,000 won. If you play a game of Bolin and wait, you have to leave as soon as you\\'re kicked out. Who\\'s going to come and play in a place like this? Everyone\\'s going there without knowing it, and then they\\'re going to rip off.See more. He\\'s too busy kicking out customers, and he\\'s been bowling, but he\\'s noticed from behind. the unkind side of the staff The cheapest drink, Coke, is 9,000 won. I\\'m not coming again. In the evening of January 11th, he called on me to throw the receipt and pay it quickly. It\\'s normal. It\\'s one drink per person, but we usually have a drink. The facilities, atmosphere, and accessibility are all good, but the price of one drink per person that you must order is bigger than your belly;;; ; be too expensive to go. It\\'s too expensive. I can\\'t leave the room too dark. For students, the price is a bit burdensome, but the atmosphere and food taste are good and it\\'s a good place to put it down on anniversaries. How could there be a new world like this when I always drank! It\\'s perfect for a group dinner. Bowling is so much fun. The facilities, atmosphere, and accessibility are all good, but the price of one drink per person that you must order is bigger than your belly;;; ; be too expensive to go. It\\'s too expensive. I can\\'t leave the room too dark. For students, the price is a bit burdensome, but the atmosphere and food taste are good and it\\'s a good place to put it down on anniversaries. How could there be a new world like this when I always drank! It\\'s perfect for a group dinner. Bowling is so much fun. The price of alcohol is enormous. Corona is 11,000 won. Coke soda. 8,000 won. I don\\'t think he can come. Bowling fee per person, 5,500 shoes, 2500 margaritas, 17000. The price of alcohol is a bit high. It\\'s a little small, isn\\'t it?. If you find a way to walk, you will be guided to the ditch, so don\\'t wander around and go straight to the entrance to Noeul Park. The scenery is much prettier and better than Sky Park, but I don\\'t know. I won\\'t go twice. The drink is 2,500 won, so take it with you in advance It\\'s the best place to go for healing. A place I\\'d like to visit - a park. Where the sunset is so beautiful. I\\'ve been there a while ago, but the location is a bit ambiguous, but the meals are so good and good. There weren\\'t that many customers, but they didn\\'t disappear. She\\'s a regular! She\\'s clean, quiet, she\\'s looking for books. Stir-fried rice is really delicious... When I read a book after eating, I get sleepy and sleep for a couple of hours.It\\'s really comfortable. I recommend it. I came here because I heard it was new, and the facilities were nice and clean. I think I\\'ll come here often. You can watch TV!. There are many kinds of board games. There are a lot of stores. Staff members recommend the game and explain the rules kindly. You should ask if you enjoyed it when you went out. Good! Oh, and it\\'s 2,400 won per hour. without including drinks It\\'s normal. It\\'s normal.. It is convenient to bring a 1,000 won bill and water before going to the four karaoke songs found in Sinrim. You can transfer money when there is an employee, and you are so kind!!! Good~~~ I like everything except for the wireless microphone. Excellent sound facility monitoring, good microphone clean facility water is expensive, but drinks are very cheap (drink and drink for 1,000 won) and toilets are clean and nice to live in (friend Good. The boss is so handsome! And also kindness. What a perfect self!I think I\\'ll go often in the future, too!. It\\'s the best.. That\\'s not a good idea. The entrance fee is also beef. Light. Hurry up and open the door!!!!!! It\\'s 9:21 PM.○○○○ is still closing the door. A doggy karaoke room.. It\\'s neat and nice.. It\\'s neat, and the service is great! I had a great time with my boyfriend^^ I watched a movie, played games, and played here for about three hours at the end of the year. The facilities were neat and the boss was kind, so I had a lot of fun.I strongly recommend this place.. Smells like a cigarette and doesn\\'t know the board game, so I can\\'t explain it.. It\\'s normal.. There are a lot of comic books and it\\'s okay, but the smell of cigarettes is so bad that only 3 people can use the game machine. How kind of a staff!  (based on September 26, 2019) The facility is very clean. I hope the cushions, dolls, etc. are always kept clean.I thought there were so many menu items that can be ordered among the comic cafe chains. There are not many kinds of comic books, but they are all covered and in good condition! It\\'s the best. Smells bad. The staff is kind.. Sperm-!♥. I don\\'t like it. I was waiting, but the female staff didn\\'t even call my name and just deleted my name from the waiting list. He didn\\'t say sorry, but he said he\\'d put it in next time. You\\'re so unkind. Not a single star is worth it.. nan. The last one in the president\\'s study was open, so I got confused. I had so much fun in the vampire room. It was fun to be active and it was good to be focused on equipment. I\\'ve tried treasure and Dracula, and I recommend this place for those who like devices with fewer locks! The staff aren\\'t that kind, so we\\'ll take out a star. The lost treasure theme was fun! It\\'s normal.. I often go to this place with a reservation for bowling plaza. 4 songs are good for 1,000 won, clean, and there are many songs! The karaoke owner here is a YouTuber... It\\'s the best.. There\\'s a lot of noise in the microphone. I almost lost my ear to the beep...I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go again. The price is low and the microphone quality is good. It\\'s a lot of service, and the facilities are clean.. loudness. Free parking for Hyundai Card M3 Card Training Center Park Parking Lot Dongdaemun 01:00 to 24:00. Free parking for ReVe.. You said you\\'d be off on Monday and Sunday, so you didn\\'t open the door or pick up the phone. I guess I\\'m screwed. It\\'s normal. I love the comfortable atmosphere. I don\\'t like it. It\\'s the best.. The downside is that you can only listen to the explanation of the board game on the computer. So customers manage the game themselves, so it feels like the game is not managed properly (whether it\\'s mixed with cards or no dice), but it\\'s okay because the unlimited fee is very cheap.. There were so many games! I used to play a lot of board games, but there were so many new and fun games here that I really didn\\'t know time was passing!! And it was really nice that unlimited tickets cost only 6,000 won!! There are so many games that I don\\'t know how time flies! It\\'s kind and cheap! A course to recommend friends or couples\\' dates. The child has to clean and wide and disinfection is well, too, and these days without adult to do, like a good thing. I\\'m having a good time with my kids.^^. I made a madhouse in Suyu Wolbo!!! It was a room escape game with a thrilling thriller genre, so I had a lot of fun.~~~ It was good to have a lot of other games besides room escape games, and there were many other simple games, so it was fun!! As if it\\'s a perfect place to play around Suyu Station, you can play all day for 56,000 won on weekdays. Maybe because it\\'s recently renewed, the interior, design is comfortable, and the drinks are delicious (Try blue lemonade or chocolate latte) Anyway, it was fun to play games from easy to the latest board games to good explanations by part-timers. It was good to stay up all night until 5 a.m.. 12,000 won per person. 24,000 won for 2 people. Scratching because it\\'s annoying. If there\\'s no one, it\\'s unlimited. If there\\'s no one, it\\'s 2 hours long. As soon as it\\'s 2 hours long, the drinks are free, and the cake is free. There\\'s no cake. There\\'s no cake. (Of course there\\'s no albaesaeng!) The room is dirty, smelly, the cash price of the card is different, and the B.M. The shoes are not locked. Part-time jobs are very unfriendly. I don\\'t like it. The snack popcorn is soggy and the facilities use the karaoke function in the early \\'90s. It doesn\\'t erase the weird background music, and it doesn\\'t seem like they\\'re trying to make money for the rest of the time, and coke tastes like herbal medicine. And she\\'s a lady, but she\\'s not polite. I felt it yesterday. I think the part-timer acted so rudely because he wasn\\'t in the store, but I hope he found out quickly that the same multi-room store across the street is different, so as soon as you enter the store, you can put your shoes where you want to put your shoe in the shoe closet. Excuse me, but can I see your ID? You were very polite. We\\'re in the same multi-room, but we\\'re different.. I think you\\'re the boss, but you\\'re being so unkind... The guests are nicer. The store is clean, the new books are well prepared, and the food is also delicious. The books and the store are in good condition.The staff is kind. We\\'re having a stamp coupon event. You can exchange it for drinks and other products, so you can get more and more products as time goes by.^^. I was going to come here on December 23rd, but I didn\\'t come here because it was so cold today, so I thought I\\'d just go. But it doesn\\'t smell like a sewer or cigarette at all? I don\\'t know if the review was improved or not, but anyway, I had a great time. The ladies\\' room is neat and nice.I don\\'t know because the groom told me that the men\\'s restroom is outside. I\\'m in, and I smell a cigarette or a sewer. I have to decide whether it smells like cigarette or sewer even if I move to another seat.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best.. Mike is a beggar.. I\\'m a little sad. I think it would be better to transfer it to Seoul Forest and manage it or drain the water and develop it.. I was just passing by because I didn\\'t have a review recently, and I think the playground will be fun for kids who are active from the age of 5-6 or older. The day after the rain, there was no puddle. It doesn\\'t look like it\\'s managed. A three-year-old girl was a little scared, so she was just passing by, and I don\\'t think she\\'s going back.. nan. It\\'s the best.. I went there today and it was so nice of you to let me know! You were so kind even though there was a deadline. There are too few part-timers. unkindness. It\\'s the best. The standard of patriotism is different from person to person and cannot be graded. As an ordinary citizen, the park is very well kept. What a nice park. Dosan Ahn Chang-ho. He was a blind believer in capitalism and did so. He tried to build a kingdom in the form of a kingdom. Not democratic, but absolute, but his pride will be highly appreciated. It\\'s normal. Why didn\\'t you come in? The perfect park in the city! I want to live on foot. Thank you for your hard work today.Have a delicious dinner and rest! Thank you for having a great day today.^^♥. Walk after lunch. I\\'ll make sure to go. Thank you. hurray for the independence of Korea hurray for the independence of Korea. Unkind, unassuming, unassisted, unheated, children have to wear socks and paddle. If you apply a time event and you get a perfect score of six songs for 1,000 won, one more song will be added.. If it was close to my house, I would like to go to a ramen restaurant every day. The facilities and toilets are clean and nice. I\\'d like to give you a rating of 5.5 if you feel like it. I want to come every day. Ramen restaurants will be open!!!  There\\'s also a dog cat. It\\'s too much. My favorite place is also a dog cat, so it follows people well and plays well. I like it because there are the most comic book types among comic cafes around here. I want to buy a regular ticket.. Never go, Mike. Trash ○ I couldn\\'t hear you 20 years ago. The sound quality of the wired microphone was so bad that it was almost called raw wood. I don\\'t like the sound It\\'s not wide, so I\\'m happy to be alone! It\\'s comfortable, but at night, there are many people and restaurants nearby, so it feels a little dangerous. Go during the day~!. nan. I was so happy that the boss was so friendly and kind, and the staff laughed so well that the atmosphere was very comfortable! The room is also available as a room, so it\\'s good for friends to enjoy comfortably. Recommendation!!! I think this table is very comfortable for playing cards...I think the quiet space and the kind service mind of the PD gives comfort to the game players!!! I enjoyed playing games with neat tables and delicious snacks.The regular customer!!!!!. It\\'s a great place.. nan. The boss was kind and had fun with the house and Psycho. The price is also the best! It\\'s a waste of a star. If the story (The Prison) is too unlikely and the staff (the old man) is too unfriendly; if you answer it like it\\'s annoying and stuffy and go get some service training... All the worst story problems are rubbish and the service is terrible. Employees are unkind and upset, and there are six locks in one room. I gave you five points because you were so kind. I think the location should be seen as Children\\'s Grand Park rather than Konkuk University, but the price is much lower than other stores. The level is higher than other places.Neyong. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Okay, where you can go for a quiet drink. The entrance to Hongdae is close to an outdoor beer house, but don\\'t give up and walk to Gajwa Station. Much better. Should we go any further? Do we really have to go further? Go until you do. It\\'s the best. Good. 京義義!園園! 美美!! 美美! 只是銀杏果實真的很臭! 像狗屎味😱😱😱!!!  #!! 主主主! 主主!! #義義 # #Gyeongui Line Forest Road # ##愛愛#Hwangchamjamjamjaengi. Is it Yeontral Park because it is similar to Central Park? The actual image shows that it\\'s embarrassing to compare to Central Park, and the size of the tree is small and the trees are dully. I\\'m embarrassed to see a foreigner who knows Central Park.. It is on the 3rd floor of the building next to the 30m Cowup Residence at Exit 6 of Seoul National University Station. There\\'s a lot to see.. Here\\'s a quiet bar on a cozy, crowded club street. Okay.. It was good to have various kinds of games!! :). Good night. It\\'s cozy, clean and... It\\'s a place where the boss is really good at managing.. nan. It\\'s quiet and the atmosphere is nice.  Personally, it\\'s better because it\\'s not too big.  Read the cartoon~~^^. The boss is kind, clean, and the coffee is delicious.^^. A coin singing room where customers of a store with a distinctive management philosophy of the president are screened.. Hongdae style in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It\\'s so nostalgic. Since it\\'s a 90s style song, I\\'m good at recreating hip-hop songs and drinking cocktails. If you take someone who has a pen in the army, you\\'ll order a reserve army night. LOL. If you drink well, you\\'ll have to drink with an elephant. I love DJing, which is hosted on Friday and Saturday at pepperoni pizza restaurants. The atmosphere is good, but it is tasteless and not twice. an extreme end-of-century concept It\\'s like a meme It\\'s fun to look around. Good night katsu was impressive. a cafe feel rather than a bar I was going to give you a star because I wanted to know. It\\'s the best.. space for the homeless and pigeons. Don\\'t go anywhere. The boss\\'s character is strange.. I\\'m a little sad. It\\'s the best. I don\\'t like it. The service...Teenagers don\\'t. It\\'s the best.. Oh my gosh, I was offended by the man here too, but I guess that\\'s the way he is.~~~~~ It seemed like he thought you were an uninvited guest.~~~~~ If you want to buy snacks for dogs, please pay for them and sit down in front of your laptop~ If you\\'re so bothered by it, don\\'t go to the cafe.... I\\'ll never go again. I don\\'t know if he\\'s a president or a male employee. Don\\'t talk to customers like that. It\\'s a very aggressive business.^^. 19.5 A visiting male president, Nam alba, is blunt, unkind, expensive, and time-limited. I could get him a drink at the counter on time, but he said, \"Two or three.\" The dog is chic... ...the best. Shiba dog nerd. But Americano is 6,000 won.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Good. Nothing to see. Except for the inconvenience of parking. Great. It\\'s crowded, but the atmosphere is good. It\\'s normal. It\\'s. Tent accident visit very good. Great. It\\'s crowded, but the atmosphere is good. It\\'s normal. It\\'s. Tent accident visit very good. Great. It\\'s crowded, but the atmosphere is good. It\\'s normal. It\\'s. Tent accident visit very good. nan. There is also a convenience store. It\\'s the best. I love it. Good. It\\'s the best. The air is so nice. It\\'s the best. Seoul Forest is good. Good. It\\'s normal. It\\'s good to see a lot of trees spread out. Good. It\\'s the best. That\\'s great. But it\\'s too much. Good. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Thank you for having such a wide forest in Seoul. I like it because there are many trees, not much to see or see. Good. It\\'s the best. Warm. I can\\'t believe there\\'s a place like this in Seoul! It\\'s louder than I thought. 今!!! !對!! 。野。。! 。野。。! 野野時時! 時時時時! 時時時: 地333 # # #Seoul Forest #愛愛 #Hwangchamjamjaengi. 생활 I love it, I want to live near here!  I don\\'t think so, so I should go there often. Good to go with your child:) Sand playground. Deer. Butterfly garden. Insect Museum. . . A quiet shelter in the middle of the city center.

Large park area and rich forest are good for taking a rest sometimes. It\\'s nice to be quiet. I like it because it has more shade and is quiet and relaxed than Olympic Park. Good. Good for a walk with a friend. Seoul Forest is always good. Okay. If you enjoy the park, you can enjoy restaurants, cafes, and other places like nearby galbi restaurants. There are so many people. The park is big. I\\'m a little sad. A good place to go on a picnic in spring. Okay. My hot place. It\\'s the best. 4. Nan. Nan. A good place to play with children. If you don\\'t have anything to do on the weekend, go there! a generous walk ... I want to see deer often. There is a forest, a wide lawn, a playground, a two-story slide, and it is good to take a rest. Reservation of program is required in addition to insect experience. Central Park in Seoul.

A good place to go on a picnic in spring. Okay.. I felt bad looking at the attitude of the boss\\'s service. The president or the male employee is very unfriendly. I don\\'t think I\\'ll come back because I\\'m upset. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Comics are also cheap. And the boss is so kind! It is perfect for a summer date!. nan. nan. Worst ever. I went home from work, but I only have office workers. I thought you just came to work. This is the company.Never go. This is a real company. Don\\'t go. Go somewhere else. No, what\\'s with the picture? This is the company. It\\'s not a cartoon cafe at Nol Forest headquarters. Cartoon. + Escape room doesn\\'t fit me very well with it. No, it\\'s a coin karaoke, but can\\'t you use coins? Well, it\\'s my fault for not having any bills.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Good. Okay.. It\\'s the best. Good.. When I came in after saying three songs are 1,000 won, I found out that the facility is clean and good, but the sound quality is black and changes people\\'s voices when printing out songs. I\\'m writing a review because I\\'m so tired of singing and spending money.. A good day to see cherry blossoms ^^ Cherry blossom fill April is really awesome. It\\'s the best place for board games without anyways. The atmosphere feels like a board game club. LOL. The price is cheap, the staff explains it well, and there are a lot of fun games.This is my favorite board cafe. The price and the coupon are good. There are so many board games! I like it even more because you explained it well! The only thing I regret is that coffee is not very good, but I always use it because there are many other cheap drinks :). I was going to pay by credit card and they told me to pay 10% of the card fee.The ring was rusty so I went to get as soon as possible, but there are a lot of customers, so come next time. ᅮI got a kind consultation and I just came out for personal reasons, but I was touched that you even greeted me.I\\'m so sorry. Thank you. You made a pretty ring with your boyfriend! It\\'s my first time, but I feel good that you teach me well. I went to meet my boyfriend half-baked, and I was worried that it would be difficult. But you taught me well so I made a pretty ring. Thank you. I got a ring this time and it\\'s so pretty. 감사합니다 감사합니다 Thank you for teaching me thoroughly!. There are so many songs that don\\'t exist. Especially, it\\'s not easy to upload a new song and the microphone or remote control button is missing. How many songs are there for 1,000 won?. It\\'s not very good, it\\'s not very good, it\\'s just... it\\'s... it\\'s not... it\\'s... it\\'s not... it\\'s not... it\\'s not... it\\'s not very good. I think you\\'re not even managing the rails. I\\'ve been bowling to see if the air conditioner isn\\'t working, and I\\'ve been sweating a lot. This is the worst bowling alley I\\'ve ever been to. That\\'s great! Board games are free, too! The atmosphere is good. It\\'s empty, it\\'The rails are too short. There\\'s a lot of kids. Go to Chaladiraja.. It\\'s close. FC Maru home stadium. soccer go go. indoor environmental comfort an easy-going board It was cold, but it was pleasant, clean, a lot of games, and I enjoyed the drink.~ 7000~85 won for drinks for 2 hours is quite satisfactory!. It\\'s good to have a lot of games, but it\\'s not soundproof, so I\\'m a little embarrassed when I sing. Most of all, the staff told our team in an irritating way from the beginning, and when I saw other teams coming in, it was very refreshing. And whenever I try to eat something, I take a deep breath. Why did you do that? The facilities were good for the price, but the employee\\'s attitude is a bit harsh.. More than I expected, if the coffee tastes good, I\\'m embarrassed.I think there are fewer books than anywhere else. It\\'s the worst. It\\'s so noisy, babies. It\\'s quiet, so I can concentrate well and clean. I can\\'t read books because of the kids, but I don\\'t want to go unless it\\'s family.. The part-timer is kind enough to tell me. But I don\\'t know if I can\\'t solve it or if the problem is a mess. The staff are very kind. There was a woman and a man, and he was so kind from the explanation to the entrance and came out, so I was happy! Instead, the Titanic theme felt like solving math problems rather than devices. I went with my friend, but I couldn\\'t escape. LOL. I went there last year or so, and you were so rude. If you don\\'t want to work, don\\'t. Don\\'t offend anyone who went to do it in a good mood. It\\'s the best.. All right, one piece rupee, indirect experience, fun gathering colleagues, the venue for the Human Conversation Agreement, which has no navy or nothing.. I think it\\'s a good name, so go and check it out. It was okay. I went to see a review that Alba is unkind, but I didn\\'t see any change, and it\\'s good to play games because there aren\\'t so many people! But the coffee is really bad. It\\'s neat, it\\'s a lot of games, and it\\'s okay. Don\\'t drink coffee. It\\'s not good. The female part-timer is so rude that she\\'s giving me the rules. I don\\'t think she\\'ll come back.. It\\'s funny, but I give you 5 points because you have a low rating. 2 points are not for sure. About 3.5 to 4? I can\\'t see the hint that you managed the props roughly and I can\\'t even see if they\\'re props or not. The room escape by the lock for the lock is really... The more easily I solve the unconvincing problems, the more I\\'m disappointed, the more money I waste. Room escape is of high quality. This is one of the most sloppy places I\\'ve ever been to. It\\'s a totally improbable story. Okay.. Finish Han River today. But I am hungry... My legs hurt.. Next time, I want to play a game with my boss\\'s recommendation!!! *_* It\\'s been a long time since I went to see my friend from Busan to Seoul. If you had fun with your friend here, the staff will explain the game easily and the drink is really delicious!! If I go to Seoul next time, I will definitely go!! It doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s been long since it\\'s been here, but the staff always welcomed it with a smile and explained the game to the point where I didn\\'t know how to do it, so I had a date as if I were going to my friend\\'s house. If I had another appointment in Sinchon, it\\'s a place with 1,000% of the intention to revisit.  It was a pleasant visit because there were various kinds of board games and drinks. The boss is so kind... The game that the boss recommended was boring. He explained it well, but it was a shame that he didn\\'t win the first place... It\\'s okay to go on a date or play a drinking game with friends! There are a lot of board games and it\\'s neat. It was uncomfortable because the games were not organized when I went to other places, but I liked the fact that it was organized well and recommended by each person. More than anything, he explains the game well and I like him because he\\'s friendly! The boss is kind and the facilities are so clean.It\\'s the best!!! All right, board game cafe with few board games. There are too few games.ᅮᅮ Not even a hundred... It\\'s just a few hundred of them. It\\'s a board cafe, and it\\'s like a card room, lighting, and a bar. The price seems to be more expensive than Hongdae. The facilities are good and the price is reasonable. I got hurt inadvertently while playing the game, and I took care of it quickly because you prepared the medicine well! It\\'s really nice and nice here.It\\'s comfortable. You can play pool here. Clean and friendly staff. It\\'s nice to have a room.. Great~ It\\'s the best. Good. I haven\\'t done it a few times, but it\\'s fun. I think it\\'d be nice if several people did it. I don\\'t like room escape as punishment, but when I went there, I was satisfied. The staff were so kind! It was a little difficult, but I should try an easy theme next time! All right, the facilities are old, so if you don\\'t press it, it won\\'t work, and if you go there for the first time, you don\\'t say you can\\'t do it, but when you sit down and wait, people who are calling for hints say you can\\'t do it after hanging up...I did a room with four stars, but it\\'s too much. I feel bad~~ You have to use the lantern from beginning to end because there is no other device at all.. It\\'s the best.. The facilities are really good!!!!!. If you are going to escape from Gangnam, make sure to go here. It\\'s so much fun compared to other illogical escape rooms. Subscribe, recommend, press like.. It\\'s a place where my friend who came with me hits me while I was zoning out in the mood. A very good time, a place where I made memories. All right. Have fun with your boyfriend all the time. Bosses are the best insiders, Red Rock and Shrimp Gambas! The boss is kind, and the atmosphere is something you can\\'t see in the real session! I strongly recommend it!    I\\'ll be your regular customer. The atmosphere was great. It was nice to talk to my acquaintances in a quiet atmosphere. I\\'m not good at drinking, but when I want to go alone quietly and have a drink, I enjoyed the time to have a cocktail and talk with the whole time. There are darts and board games, and it\\'s a great place to have fun with. It\\'s a good song to choose and it\\'s good to take pictures with a lot of care. I think I\\'ll go often. Make sure to go there. I visited with my girlfriend, and the boss was so kind and enjoyed the cocktail.  I loved the atmosphere and music. I\\'ll visit you again next time. I think you decorated the interior really pretty. Do you look good in the picture? It looked so pretty, and the cocktail was so delicious!! There were so many things to play in a good atmosphere!!Nice appearance, nice atmosphere, good music! The best :). You\\'re the best!. Yeongdeungpo Pigeons Gathering Place. Alba = unfriendly enough to fall within five fingers of a Hongdae establishment. It\\'s not blunt, it\\'s just like picking a fight. Facilities = The unique smell of mold, bathroom, and star smell are all left. Guitar = I broke my glass by mistake, and I was told to pay back mercilessly. Don\\'t go. The worst cocktail bar I\\'ve ever been to, only female cocktail makers wear masks and serving staff don\\'t even wear masks -- and there\\'s a worker who says he\\'s fever, but he doesn\\'t know why he came to work, and he doesn\\'t use a mezer cup when making cocktails, and he makes his own phone and makes it taste dirty and just uses it. Why are you so cheap? The store is full of dusty cobwebs all over the place to see if you don\\'t even clean. It smells like a bathroom because it\\'s underground. It usually tastes like water in a cocktail. Go to another unlimited refill cocktail restaurant. I used to go there often, but I became too unfriendly. Relieved. I thought you were a part-timer or an employee. It\\'s an unlimited cocktail, but I felt uncomfortable ordering it. I\\'m so unkind that I don\\'t want to go again. I can\\'t even see handmade burgers more than half of the menu because the boss is away during the week...That\\'s why I went... Although I expressed my regret, I am planning to go out and buy some snacks thanks to the part-timers who can\\'t communicate with my boss.. It\\'s well-equipped and well-organized. It\\'s the best. Honestly, there seems to be no bowling alley like this in Seoul, but the facilities are clean and the bowling ball is well prepared to suit people\\'s hands. The facilities are good and the service is good. neat facilities and atmosphere. a comic book store with everything it needs. It\\'s a waste of a star. The facility is so underdeveloped and it looks like a spider\\'s web is about to come out. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go again. They give us a lot of service hours, and the owner is kind, so we have an intention to revisit.. I went there at night, and I wanted to get rid of the way the male staff was rude and looked down on the customers! And there aren\\'t many board games prepared. It was spacious and pleasant, but there were many kinds of games, and the staff kindly explained the game one by one and the price was good. The drink was delicious and there was a fixed amount for 2 to 5 hours, so it was good. They explain very well and there are so many kinds of games!! You\\'re the best.. It\\'s a great place.. It was so much fun. I want to go again.. Joa. There are various board games and the food is delicious.. The story and visual various devices. The theme is fun and above all, the staff is so kind that I want to go there again. I\\'ve tried two secret agents and I want to try all the other themes. But there\\'s no weird problem. This is a good house! spilling fun. nan. The store is clean and cheap, so it\\'s really good to spend time. 1,000 won per hour, 5,000 won per week, 4,000 won at night.. I was watching a movie with my friend, but I couldn\\'t concentrate because he was so chatty outside whether he was an employee or an employee friend. I keep on worrying. I don\\'t like it.. nan. It hasn\\'t been long since it opened, so it\\'s clean and good. But there\\'s a cigarette smell in it.. There are only about 10 old and large comics without a back page. The same goes for famous films such as Inuyasha. Only when you get one-nable charter can you see the latest book. When I asked the owner, he said it\\'s because of the out-of-sale, so it\\'s hard to get the front ticket, but he made a ridiculous excuse. I like Ewha branch because it is quieter and more comfortable than other branches. I\\'ve studied there for a while, but I think it\\'s better than a cafe. There is a big window, so it is good to read books with the sunlight during the day. + Your boyfriend lost his AirPods yesterday, but he didn\\'t get them even if I asked him for a reward. The owner and uncle are angels too. The part-timer was kind during the day. It\\'s good to sit down and relax. The tteokbokki was better than I thought and the taste of coffee was very disappointing. However, it is less fun to read various comic books than to occasionally retrieve old treasures from comic books that have wandered from place to place. Without this, there are some things that are not comic books. I feel a little uncomfortable because the bathroom is upstairs. It\\'s normal. It\\'s the best. The facilities are good, but the manager\\'s mind, such as the counter, is not at all. I went to a cafe other than a cafe where I only drink coffee with my boyfriend, but I didn\\'t know the time was passing and I think I had a good date.^^ I\\'m leaving a comment because I was so satisfied with it. I went to Sinchon Nori Forest on Facebook and I went to the wrong place.The employees are sullen... It\\'s narrow and...I don\\'t have any books. After visiting Sinchon Nol Forest, it seems that Sinchon Nol Forest is the best. The irony is why it\\'s so popular in this generation to search for Shinchon Nori Forest.. Please tell me the hours of operation.. nan. It\\'s normal. It\\'s the best. View good. The best course for riding a bicycle! There are quite a few people coming by bicycle, so I hope there are many bike storage facilities. Bicycles are dangerous at night. It\\'s the best. It\\'s so pretty here. I want to enjoy the scenery and have a cup of coffee someday. All right: You have to go to the side of the unit to enjoy it properly. Never take a car unless it\\'s dawn. I can\\'t use the parking lot welfare card. Please fix it. The view is nice, but the cafe is so tasteless and expensive and it is abandoned. Drive Course & Seoul Night View... It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. A drive course on a drizzling day. It\\'s normal. It\\'s the best. Bob just went to see the scenery. Rain falls on the top of octagonal pavilion in the lower neighborhood. A nice night view. Not as good as I thought. The place overlooking Seoul. The observatory. Run along the Bukak Skyway and look down at Seoul. All right, all right. The place overlooking Seoul. The observatory. Run along the Bukak Skyway and look down at Seoul. All right, all right. A good place to drive and rest for a while. ● A drive to find a way out. On a sunny and sunny day, the scenery is great. It\\'s cool and the night view is so pretty and so nice! A cup of coffee at a cafe in the evening is a nice place to see the night view. [Pyeongchang-dong] Together. A fine day is octagonal. The view is nice. The view is very tight. When you need healing in downtown Seoul. 2013 Autumn... There is no parking space every day when you drive to a place you come alone, and even the weekend when you park on the street. The night view is amazing. A place with a nice night view. It\\'s all a couple...Wants of care...ᅲᅲ. nan. 좋지. Hyundai Motor Company Respects Human Resources!! The chief, the deputy, and the octagonal pavilion of Mt. Bukak! The place I used to hang out with when I was young... A good place to drive and rest for a while. ● A drive to find a way out. On a sunny and sunny day, the scenery is great.

The view is nice.. It\\'s the best if you go when you have a lot of free time before the show. It\\'s comfortable and I rested well. It\\'s really annoying to talk sarcastically about how a woman boss is so rude.. Daughter Baramakgeolli has a good price range. The side dishes and makgeolli are delicious!! However, the price is a bit expensive, but if you want to go when you want makgeolli, there is a doctor who visits again! Alcohol and complacency are delicious. It\\'s not a lot and the price range is a bit high. I have an intention to revisit. Chosun chicken cheese is very sweet. I can\\'t eat it because my tongue is going to melt after mixing it. What kind of cheese did you use? The oil was just... I\\'m just a flat... Honey makgeolli is delicious and daughter bar rice wine is more delicious! Let\\'s go eat makgeolli instead of snacks! Just rice wine! I took a good picture and it came out delicious. I went there because I craved rice wine. Oh, my God. It\\'s so delicious. The combination of squid samhap and egg chestnut makgeolli... I\\'m so happy. Mostly, the side dishes are expensive, but the biggest drawback is the small amount. I think tofu kimchi and all kinds are better, but I can\\'t stop the taste of makgeolli. I still don\\'t know why the amount changes every time I go there. Sometimes I go when I want to eat fruit makgeolli. Acknowledged as the honey rice wine of the Joseon Dynasty ^^ I recently ate grapefruit mango rice wine, but as expected, honey is the best  꿀 The side dishes taste good!^^. nan. I was going to come here on December 23rd, but I didn\\'t come here because it was so cold today, so I thought I\\'d just go. But it doesn\\'t smell like a sewer or cigarette at all? I don\\'t know if the review was improved or not, but anyway, I had a great time. The ladies\\' room is neat and nice.I don\\'t know because the groom told me that the men\\'s restroom is outside. I\\'m in, and I smell a cigarette or a sewer. I have to decide whether it smells like cigarette or sewer even if I move to another seat.. Why did you just find out? the best of the best. It\\'s not safe, but it\\'s not bad. It\\'s the best. It\\'s not Seoul-ro. It\\'s good for taking a walk or taking night view. I can\\'t see it on the Kakao Map satellite map. Please re-record it with the latest one. But it\\'s better to do both sides of the road... The night view is the best. Concrete emotion. It\\'s normal. The width of the sidewalk is too narrow for the number of floating population. The overall atmosphere is good. It\\'s a bit disappointing, but it\\'s okay as it is because it has a good purpose. Busking is the best! Good. When I heard that I was going to make this, I was wondering what kind of park it was. I went to Seoul Station and stopped by and found out that it was pretty well. There were pianos everywhere, flowers and trees, mini ponds, and it was a pretty nice downtown park.. You know, this part-timer here isn\\'t so cheap.. Sky stairs are okay when you go up, but the worst when you come down. It will be corrected only when the sky stairs are forcibly recalled for half a day. Sky Park is hard to go because there are so many beautiful places or people. O. It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. The best scenery. The pink color. I\\'ve seen it once, but it\\'s too bad! There\\'s a story. . . . .that\\'s the best. I went there in autumn, and the night view is so beautiful on a nice day. Seoul night view is a good place to see. I want to go again next time. A place to recommend to anyone along with Namsan! I went to the silver grass festival and it was pretty and spacious and there were many people, but it was good to see that I paid attention in many ways. It\\'s the best place to see the sunset. This place has been used as a landfill in Seoul for a long time, but I can\\'t believe it has been transformed into a tourist destination. It\\'s the best. We got there imagining a beautiful silver spoonbills, but we got rid of more than 70 percent of them, and the rest of them were being cut down by the machine. For those who are coming here, I think it would be better to just go for exercise rather than scenery. You\\'re the best. You\\'re the best. If you go in November and December, it\\'s perfect! Beautiful silver spoonbills leave life pictures. Eoksei Festival + Pinkmuley + Dabsari. There were a lot of people, but I liked the autumn mood, such as silver grass and pink mulin dapss. Good. It\\'s the best. If you go in November and December, it\\'s perfect! Beautiful silver spoonbills leave life pictures. Eoksei Festival + Pinkmuley + Dabsari.

It\\'s near the company, but I\\'ve never been there before, and it\\'d be better if I came here during the day two days in a row to celebrate the silver grass festival. It\\'s hard to climb up.

The scent of Bongyeon coffee still lingers at the tip of my nose. He explained how to eat kindly and overall, the cozy cafe atmosphere was good. A kind boss. I ate grapefruit ade and blue lemonade. It was really delicious! It\\'s not bland at all, and it\\'s a bit spicy! The owner is kind and the store is pretty, so it was nice!. nan. There are a lot of things to do here.Please don\\'t go. The mind itself is rotten.. The bowling alley is so clean~~~~ The coffee near the snack corner is so delicious.*^^*~. It\\'s really neat and has an event price, so it\\'s really cheap. (I don\\'t know how long the event will last.) Coffee tastes good, beer, ramen and snacks. It\\'s well-maintained and good! However, the parking lot is a parking lot that goes down by Elbe, but it\\'s an old building, so big cars can\\'t be used by Elbe. There are two parking lots, but other parking lots were hard to park because there were so many cars... It is a new bowling alley, so it is totally good.*^^*~Rain is really good, too*^^*~. nan. I went on a weekday evening and the male part-timer was really kind! I sometimes go near my house, but I don\\'t have many books. I\\'m annoyed with my close-up job on Saturday and listen to what I want to understand. It\\'s nice to have a nice and pleasant boss! No book, John 1. The seats are pleasant. The staff are kind, but I\\'ve never been to any of the best amusement parks I\\'ve ever been to. There\\'s really nothing to see. It\\'s the best.. The food is delicious and there are lots of seats. There is an arcade and board game is fun. I go often.I hope it stays for a long time. It\\'s just a clean cafe concept. I don\\'t have enough books for cartoon enthusiasts. There are many cartoons that do not increase the number of books rather than bunk beds. Board games, oric rooms, and comic books. Nacho and Doncas are so delicious!!. Two rooms a day. One was so fun. One was so scary. I\\'d like to. It\\'s the best. The staff are very kind and very good at explaining. It was so nice to sit down because it was like a cafe. I strongly recommend... Employees are kind and clean because it\\'s new. The facilities were spacious and clean. It was nice to see the staff.. If you get 100 points for 4 songs, 1,000 won, one more song will be good! We\\'ll give you five stars!!! The back door is dark and it feels like a road to hell, but it\\'s okay to go through the front door.. 1919.03.01 Historic Site I don\\'t like it. It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. The birthplace of the March 1 Independence Movement. Pagoda Park has been renamed Tapgol Park, the playground for the elderly, the birthplace of the March 1 Independence Movement. The birthplace of the Samil Movement, the Wongak Temple Site, the National Treasure No. 2 of Korea\\'s largest senior citizen center, the 10-story stone pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site, and the historic site with the Treasure No. 3 Wongak Sabi.. nan. It\\'s not easy to feel unkind in a coin karaoke where you don\\'t often run into the owner, but it\\'s great. an attitude that makes me feel like I\\'m spending it shamelessly for free.. Good. It\\'s the best. It\\'s not a walk, it\\'s an uphill road. It\\'s the best. I saw the sunset and it\\'s so pretty. It was hard to climb up, but I liked the sky. The night view is not the best, but the atmosphere of the fortress is the best along with the night view. I used to be able to go up to an acid castle and have a can of beer, but now it\\'s well known and banned. I like it because it\\'s close to my house. In mid-April, spring flowers bloom so beautifully along the castle road leading to Hyehwa Gate. The scent of lilacs from time to time~ I didn\\'t know there would be such a pretty walkway in the middle of Seoul. It\\'s a healing trail. It\\'s the best.

There are various board games and the food is delicious.. I looked it up because I didn\\'t want to go to Hongdae, but there\\'s a bowling alley near Mapo Station, so I\\'ll make a reservation by phone and go right away! I got a college student discount and played with Jam... The lane is pretty short. I think they cut it down to put a bunch of rain in a small space. Also, it is too expensive as others say. I understand that it\\'s 6,500 won per person per game per weekend/2,000 won for a conversation, but I have to order one drink per person. I\\'ve never seen a bowling alley like this before.6000 won for an Americano... It\\'s more expensive than Starbucks.  They say that they are selling their seats with guts, but I think it\\'s too much. I don\\'t like it. On weekends, it\\'s 6,500 won for shoes, 2,000 won for shoes, and you have to order 1 drink per person. It\\'s 10,000 won for beer and 12,000 won for the rest, but it\\'s on sale. A handful of Bud 5 bottles of nachos? You give me 50,000 won... It was less than an hour, but it cost me 200,000 won for seven people.Everyone, it\\'s cheaper to take a taxi and go somewhere else, including transportation. Two frozen pizza for 20,000 won. Three bottles of beer and a plate of nachos and ketchup are 40,000 won. The game fee is 6,000 won each.  I thought it would be expensive, but three of us played for 90 minutes and it came out to 150,000 won. It is better to know that it is expensive. It\\'s one drink per person, but drinks and beer are very expensive and I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go again because of their unkindness. I went to the get-together and the atmosphere is nice! I\\'m so excited. I\\'ll go often. Surprised by the interior... Surprised by the music...I had a lot of fun. I also liked various cocktails... I like being close to work the most.. The part-timer\\'s knowledge of comic books is zero. From his irritating speech to his facial expression, if you want to visit him, please go to a different place. The facilities are just as good as other locations, and they\\'re not bad. Except the staff isn\\'t very kind. Good. It\\'s quiet because there are not many people, so it\\'s good to read or study.. Bite the ceiling of room 21. LOL. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. The mountain right in front of my house! The air is fresh, the sound of nature!  Since last year when I was in bad condition, I was busy climbing the mountain for an hour, but after my back was broken, I heard it was good to walk, so I climbed again! It\\'s been a long time since I climbed it, so it\\'s hard!!. It\\'s not big, but I like it because it\\'s unexpectedly clean and there are a lot of books. It\\'s the best. It\\'s nice and neat and has a lot of comic books. The boss is kind and I like it because he cleans up every time the customer leaves. You\\'re kind and nice.. It\\'s romantic. The view was the best among all the Han River parks I\\'ve ever visited. If you want to enjoy the Han River, come here! I want to visit you again with beer on a fine day.*_*.*. A good first reason to live near Han River. I love it. A place where you can enjoy the atmosphere near your house. The atmosphere is good. Every evening my walk~* All right. Free parking for Hyundai Card M3 Card 09:00 to 21:00 (November to March) 09:00 to 23:00 (April to October). Free of all thoughts. After the service, a date at Han River Park. A good place to jog while looking at Yeouido! Where the sunset is beautiful... 2013 September 3rd, 2013 Mangwon Han River Citizens\\' Park.. The day when the sunset was so beautiful.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s a park by my name. Hahaha.. It\\'s neat, cheap, and nice. I like it better because it doesn\\'t smell like cigarettes. Haha. I took a good rest. You can play games if you have a lot of things to play, and there are general books, and the seats are wide and fun! I\\'m going to try some food next time. It\\'s the best. It\\'s not in every book I\\'m looking for. A kind, neat, cozy, and nice comic cafe.  I don\\'t care where you sit, how you sit, or how long you sit.  Rabokki is good, too.. I enjoyed the game because you explained it kindly.~~~~~ Good~ There are many kinds of games and they recommended and explained board games well. There is no separate room, but it is open like a regular cafe!. nan. It was 6,500 won per game (Saturday at 6 p.m.) and 2,000 won in cash. I was so excited about the music that I played bowling while dancing. Weekend visit. It is more expensive than other bowling alley nearby and rail is not very satisfactory. So-so... it wasn\\'t that bad. I\\'m not a good bowler, so it was okay to hang out with friends over a beer, and the staff was kind.  But I couldn\\'t get the ball back because of the pin. I didn\\'t know that, and I rolled another ball, and it was like pooping on a clogged toilet, but I laughed a lot because of that happening.It was good to drink and play lightly. I don\\'t like it. The rails are so short that the spinders don\\'t even have a lot of houseballs.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s normal. I laughed so hard with my friends. I barely survived. The facility is the best in Korea! The fun of bowling is different. I don\\'t know how time flies.. Oh! If you get 100 points, you get a service and it\\'s pleasant and nice:. It\\'s too loud. There\\'s not much food, and it\\'s more like a space than a cafe.. It\\'s the best. My favorite cartoon cafe. There are various chairs and the food is so delicious!!! It\\'s not just instant food, but it\\'s also well-organized, so I go there often.. I don\\'t like it. It was much better than I thought! The oil condition of the rail is not good and the pins are cheap, so I felt that there was not enough cool taste. There are almost no balls over 14 balls. For those who are looking for heavy balls, refer to it. I came at 9:30 and they told me to go to the leftmost lane, but I didn\\'t turn off the scoreboard. I hit it once because it was so hard for me, and suddenly a female employee came and said I had to wait for an hour. When we called, he said he could hit us right away, so I asked him what he was talking about, and he said he couldn\\'t make a reservation, so he had to wait. Then shouldn\\'t you tell me in advance? I\\'ve been arguing and you won\\'t say anything. So when I went to the counter to cancel it, he said he was in the 8th lane. He said he was wrong. He didn\\'t apologize until the end. He said he didn\\'t say it. He\\'s the only one here. Cancel it because it\\'s so funny and just leave and lose about 20 minutes. ᄏAt least say sorry. Even when you cancel, you don\\'t tell us to put a card on you and just stand there until we give you a card. You know you\\'re sitting at the counter all day long like yourself. Anyway, fold the lining again.. It was a bit like that way They\\'re angry that they\\'ll bring it to them if they take it for a board game. But they don\\'t look at me well or bring me anything. They say that unlimited fare is limited in explanation, but it\\'s not limited at all but they don\\'t do it at all. There are many board game cafes in Gangnam, but I don\\'t know if I have to go there. I felt very bad. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go again. I don\\'t know if you\\'re a male owner or a part-time worker, but you\\'re so unkind. I don\\'t really want to come back. It\\'s normal. Okay.. Here are three branches in Hongdae. Don\\'t go all three... It\\'s really cheap, it\\'s storyless, and it\\'s ridiculous when you really escaped. It took some time to solve the problem because the alphabet of the lock was missing, and I opened the box, but it was not set up again, so it\\'s all open. Haha. Do you want me to give you another theme?I asked for a refund, and they said they would only give me 50 percent of the refund.Thanks to you, I\\'m not going to the escape room cafe again. The fear was high, but it wasn\\'t scary, it was empty. The probability of the problem is a little low. The facilities are very clean!  Follow the speakers and microphone sounds! Karaoke is good, but the photos of the blog review are all the same.. The song I wanted didn\\'t start because the machine broke down, but I didn\\'t answer the manager\\'s call, and I found it in another room, and it didn\\'t have that song (two or three months old) as if it\\'s not managed at all. Dirty and unmanaged. I don\\'t like it.. A good walking path to think. All right. 10:00-16:00 1 hour, no more than 60 people per hour. Free admission every Monday. http://www.seocho.seoul.kr/umyeon pre-order (Internet, Phone). Facilities. Notepad not erased, improbable, or brainless. The staff were kind. I couldn\\'t solve all the questions, but you explained it in detail at the end and solved it, so I saw the great ending. The Gangnam branch of the mystery room had a higher percentage of electronic devices than mechanical locks, so children seemed to be very interested. I was satisfied... Please explain the kindness of the staff. Even though the devices are out of order and the problem is solved, the locks are out of order and even the owner can\\'t unlock them, so the owner of the machine lost money due to the owner\\'s fault, but there is no apology and no compensation. It is true that the boss is a bit unfriendly and dry, but compared to other stores, there are many fancy sets and amazing gadgets, and there are many fun things. And the part-timers explain the game well and they are cool and pretty. ^^. Many people went, and they told me to combine all the lanes and keep asking me how many more games I\\'m going to play, and they\\'re telling me to go fast... It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. Luminous bowling from 11 p.m. 2,500 won for canned beer!. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy...The boss is also kind and he is very good at parking.. You\\'re so kind. It\\'s relaxing and comfortable!. I\\'ve never seen you using a strange lane in your life. The place where the ball goes to break my ball with a thud in the changing part of the lane. There\\'s no oil on the other side of the material. And the shoe rental machine is very new. You can put in money, but if you want to pay with a card, you\\'re told to pay 10 percent more -- if you stab the Credit Finance Association, that\\'s it. You\\'re such a jerk to pay for your shoes. You\\'re such a bummer. I\\'ve never seen a lane like that in my life.Folding. It\\'s clean and nice here, and there are lots of books... It is similar in size to other comic book cafes in Gangseo-gu, but the lack of cleanliness is.. At first, I thought it was only a short time since it opened. Same after nearly six months...There aren\\'t many books... I moved to Hwagok-dong and went to play. The comic book status is clean, and there is a sofa that I lie down on. The building seems to be old, but it\\'s clean since it\\'s been newly opened. I\\'ve been here a few times, and it\\'s the biggest and cleanest place I\\'ve ever been to..  ·. A small comma in the Nakseongdae. not much. Mikey\\'s ears are cracking, so I haven\\'t been looking for a long time to change rooms, so I don\\'t have time, and I\\'m just annoyed, but you should be at the counter.. If four people play for an hour, it\\'s 20,000 won. But I don\\'t know if I clean the floor, but I can see the lumps of dust everywhere. It\\'s fun.. There are many books!. The part-timer is too loud. Isn\\'t the comic book cafe a bit quiet? Because of that, it was noisy for everyone else to read the comic book. Please refer to it. The cat is calm and cozy. Caramel macchiato is too bad. If there are more webtoon comic books, hehehe. There are lots of coffee sheep and cats are so pretty. Cute cats roam around...! With five cats. A good place to watch cartoons.. I\\'ll be there around 12:00 and get 30 minutes of service, and the microphone will snap and the button won\\'t work.The facilities are not very good, but I was tricked by the review of two thousand won songs.. It\\'s the best.. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m playing my part in a comic book store.  I don\\'t have many books. The state of the book is not so good. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s clean! The room is a little small and it\\'s not soundproof, so I can hear everything. The worst thing is that I\\'ve never been in the room before whether I\\'m an employee or a part-timer, but suddenly he told me to put my shoes in without any explanation, and even if I kept on guiding him to the room and he kept on using his cell phone, I felt bad because I kept seeing him being bothered in his attitude. The staff is kind, and the room and the self-bar are clean. It\\'s good to watch Netflix for free, and it\\'s good to have toast and ice cream, except for the soundproofing.. nan. All right. The boss is kind. I haven\\'t tried any food, and the drinks are okay. perfect for a ding-gul-gulling Okay.. All right. It\\'s quiet and the best!!!   There aren\\'t many people~ It\\'s quiet and good to take a walk.  The night view of Banghwa Bridge is wonderful. hehehe. Let\\'s go exercise! Enjoying basketball on the weekend. I\\'m way short of goalposts.. I like the theme and the staff members are kind.. The coffee is delicious and the bread is really delicious. It\\'s the best. The taste of service. Coffee specialty that\\'s hard to find in this town. Coffee and croissant are the best!. The lock was unlocked by an employee\\'s mistake, so we couldn\\'t proceed anymore. It\\'s a human job, so I\\'ll try to understand the mistake, but since then, the staff and the boss have been in such a mess that I don\\'t want to visit again. I really don\\'t know why I\\'m here. It\\'s so much fun. Compared to other places, I think we made a good theme room. I was embarrassed because my friends screamed that it was amazing. I should try the horror room next time. It\\'s fun. I\\'ve tried the secret room and it\\'s done well. I was satisfied overall except for the small waiting area.. Cat. The price is the best! The food quality is good!! . . Lamb skewers without lamb skewers. Sheep 30, sausage, pork and other low-priced meat, 70. She went to eat lamb, but forced them to mix it. I\\'m afraid the guest is inverted. The staff are so nice and full! Everything is hard except for the sausage. I\\'m a little sad.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s so nice to have such a nice park right next to Magok Byeoksan Mountain and Kumho Apartment. It\\'s nice that the park is nature-friendly and has a beautiful view. In addition, it is good because it is connected to Seoul Botanical Garden and Han River.. Unkind, trashy and dirty. The Rakhu Coin Karaoke next door is much better.. Kind, nice to go with friends, and kind to part-timers. I visit you when I think of you because of the mascot, Welsh Corgi Muru. It\\'s not the cutest thing in this world. Cafe owner\\'s kind and accurate explanation, various games, kind part-timers.  This is a place you\\'ll keep looking for if you live close by. If you ask me how many times I\\'ve been talking about picking out a board game, I\\'ll just give it to you. Other than that, the two of us were talking, and the rules came out. The way the boss or manager talked was very unpleasant. I asked you to bring me a game of the company that I want to play, but the game company is only fun for children in a way that scolds us. If you don\\'t know, just take our recommendations.\" Eventually, he didn\\'t ask our doctor and he just brought the game and explained it to us.;; I understand the intention of making the guests play a fun game, but we clearly said that there was a game we wanted, but the attitude of ignoring it completely was ridiculous. Later, I secretly asked another employee to play the game we wanted, and we had a lot of fun, and I felt uncomfortable all the time because you treated the customers as just ignorant people who don\\'t know board games. Return visit 0%~fold. It\\'s the best.. The employee is too unfriendly. The people on the side came up a second after I was in a finisher\\'s pose on the approach, and they kept throwing, throwing, throwing, throwing, throwing, throwing the ball, throwing it late. So I thought it would be better to move the lane to the next lane than to say it directly, so I asked to move it to the next lane, but the staff came all the way to the next lane and told me that it was okay to come up to the approach during the finish position. But actually, I was playing with grass equipment, and did you think he would not notice it? I didn\\'t feel good about finding fault with him because I was so uncomfortable. I\\'m not going to go again because my approach is not good enough.Folding. There\\'s a bowling pin on the bowling alley that\\'s in the trend of disappearing because there\\'s no bowling alley. It\\'s normal. I saw the old boss scolding the employees there, and he\\'s scared. I\\'ve been going around for months and I don\\'t want to go because of an unkind employee. You don\\'t seem to have any intention of doing business.  Even so, bowling alley is very unpleasant and rude to people. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t admit my mistake. Not a word.  I don\\'t have service management, so I won\\'t be able to see this review, right? I\\'m not gonna make any improvements. He said that to me too, but it\\'s not basic at all What kind of place is You told me to come, but I don\\'t know. I\\'m sorry. The worst!. I was fooled by the SNS advertisement. I ordered a mild flavor, but it was so salty and sweet that I quickly got sick of it. If you\\'re embarrassed because the noodles are not balanced, the noodles are really strong and the chicken is bland. It\\'s a bit disappointing. The taste is whatever, but the amount is larger than I thought. January 4, 2019. Good good.. It\\'s good to have a card machine in each room. It\\'s closer than the first store, so I\\'ll go often when the Korona situation calms down.. It\\'s been a long time since I saw an old friend.I like the Indian playground.. I\\'ve been there twice, but it\\'s unkind and I don\\' Good. The place I visited for a cup of coffee, it\\'s almost the only cafe open on the day of Chuseok! The coffee I was looking for was here. As of today, I make a regular reservation: I don\\'t like it. Delicious food is comfortable! But it\\'s noisy.... Mood gangster!Hahaha, a place quite famous in my neighborhood. The atmosphere was nice and the pasta was really delicious. I saw a lot of couples. The price is reasonable and it\\'s not too cheap or too sweet. It\\'s so soft that it stays in my memory for a long time. I think it\\'s a local restaurant. Wow~ I almost cried after eating carbonara with my son. The clean taste is really good... Thank you very much for opening the store in front of my house. I am really living thanks to the cafe. The taste is basic. It\\'s clean and modern. You\\'re the best. Please continue to do that. Grapefruit ice flakes are awesome!! Other drinks and dishes are full of sincerity. The price is nice~ Hongje-dong\\'s hidden attraction! Oops! Grapefruit board car+chicken quesadilla jackpot@@;. It\\'s just, like, twice as much fun as I\\'m already a regular.Only those who have tried the chef\\'s kind and sincere dishes and the sweet, sweet remix-board car & barista\\'s coffee. Anyway, I think I\\'ll find it often with my friend.I\\'m in America for a while, so I\\'ll have to find it soon when I get back! There is a brunch cafe in Hongje-dong.  The brunch set and coffee are 8,000 won, but toast, salad, eggs, and mushroom soup... It\\'s plentiful, so I think it\\'ll be good for two girls to eat... We ordered tomato pasta because there are 3 of us, but I liked it because it was spicy. I ordered an ade made with fruit syrup that I made myself, but three of them ate a lot because they gave me another cup for free. It\\'s clean, pricey, and delicious.. Our neighborhood park is peaceful and nice after moving in.. That\\'s expensive for the neighborhood. 5,000 won. The room escape itself was very well made. Is it because of the large scale and the large number of customers? Although it was regrettable that there were many employees at the counter, it was not organized, but the story was still solid compared to other half escape, and the various themes were unique, so it was definitely Roomz. Usually, people go up to the fourth floor after receiving payment and guidance in the basement. The basement was much wider than I thought. There are board games and drinks and snacks. What\\'s regrettable is that there are many part-timers, but they don\\'t teach them much. Everyone does not deviate far from the desk radius and informs it only by beckoning. So I asked a lot; what are you doing over there? You can just go up. in this way So I\\'ll give you 3 stars. The part-timers on the fourth floor were nice. Explain in detail the problems you don\\'t know. Also, what\\'s disappointing is that it\\'s a bit more expensive than the average room escape price? I think it was 1.8~20,000 won, but it was 220,000 won here. (Based on my theme) Still, I\\'ll be a room escape fan. I\\'m a little sad. It\\'s the best. The store is spacious and the staff is kind. There is a good board game, too. It was the most fun since Pilhwal is famous.. Aside from the game, the boss is very unfriendly. I arrived before the reservation time, and he was telling me that I was really late, that I was late, that if I didn\\'t start now, I\\'d be late, so I\\'d have to explain it roughly and start. The room actually comes out in 30 minutes. I was underdeveloped, but I had a lot of fun. This is the least interesting place I\\'ve ever been to... I heard that the automatic device is 80 percent, but it\\'s not... I don\\'t know if it\\'s because there\\'s no one working, but even if I ask for a hint, they don\\'t respond right away and I can It was even dark, so there was no problem, and there was a malfunction...  It\\'s not a place to go in anticipation of the story. It was close to money. I\\'m addicted to escape room cafes. Exodus Hongdae was the best. We\\'ve tried everything from the level of difficulty to the level of award. As if you\\'re back to your childhood at the Olympics, the game is so fun and you should try to escape the zombies. It\\'s so much fun! It was the worst room escape I\\'ve ever been to in Hongdae. The male staff explained it to me at first, and all the people I went to, including me, felt that he spoke too fast and roughly. So I couldn\\'t understand two-thirds of the explanation. The escape room cafe was an important part of the explanation, but it was so disappointing that the problem was less connected than other escape cafes, so there were many parts where it was disconnected whether it was right or what to do next. It\\'s 17,000 won even if you get a double cash discount or a good discount, but it\\'s not that cheap and I don\\'t want to recommend it. Compared to other room escape cafes that offer social discounts, it\\'s really bad.Folding. I enjoyed reading comic books in the cold weather. You\\'re so kind and I feel good. I go often.. The part-timer is kind enough to tell me. But I don\\'t know if I can\\'t solve it or if the problem is a mess. The staff are very kind. There was a woman and a man, and he was so kind from the explanation to the entrance and came out, so I was happy! Instead, the Titanic theme felt like solving math problems rather than devices. I went with my friend, but I couldn\\'t escape. LOL. I went there last year or so, and you were so rude. If you don\\'t want to work, don\\'t. Don\\'t offend anyone who went to do it in a good mood. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s fun. The part-timer is so unkind. I went to make a reservation. I was explaining, and I went to get money from another customer who didn\\'t make another reservation. I didn\\'t come back for a long time and asked if I read the game description book and he didn\\'t even bother me. I don\\'t think it\\'s here. I couldn\\'t solve it all, but at the end of the horror theme, the staff came and tried to release me and surprise me, but I\\'m sorry I wasn\\'t surprised. I think the staff must have felt awkward because you two were so expressionless... Way to go! When you\\'re having a mental breakdown, you let me know. So I went through a lot of hardships.It\\'s fun! I\\'m excited. It was really fun! The money seems to be unified everywhere, but the theme was well done in many ways. Good. Dirty and unmanaged. It\\'s not just one or two times that high school students, who are food hot springs and garbage dumps, have been riding trays all over the place and almost bumped into each other.  I think the owner is unkind.. The facilities are clean, but the part-timer is so unfriendly that I feel bad. The new facilities are clean and nice, so we have a good time. The part-time worker\\'s unkind song is too low.  Volume is also small with remote control. be dull. White theme. It\\'s the best.. It opens at 9:30 and closes at 5:30. If you\\'re going to see a building or a big wall, please refer to the time!! The park itself is 24 hours.  Monday is a holiday Be careful when you make a schedule.  Go down, go to the exhibition hall on the right, and then go inside, and there are stairs on the right. You can see the building if you go down the stairs. It\\'s really the best. It\\'s the best. It\\'s a park in central Seoul. The night view is great. The sound of the train goes well with it. I think I\\'m going to win an architectural award this year.. nan. It\\'s not good at all. I gave you a weird seat in front of the entrance and said, \"There are a lot of seats, can I move?\" I don\\'t think I can. Then I\\'ll take the employees away. Don\\'t come. The cleanliness and service were really bad when I went there before, but you\\'ve become very kind recently. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve changed your part-time job or notRamen is also delicious and pleasant. I went to a cartoon cafe with my children for the first time in a long time, and it was more pleasant than I thought. I will go often~ 라면 Ramen is so delicious. Isn\\'t the basic spirit of self-employment the worst in the service industry? Is it normal to yell and get angry if I\\'m the one cleaning up when I accidentally put a blanket in the process of moving? What if he\\'s not a cleaner? Aren\\'t you in charge of the Tong Thun Omok Bridge?  If you\\'re going to run a business with this kind of service, you\\'re done. Just haha. Why don\\'t you run a designated seat in the first place or write \"No moving seats, no looking around\" in big letters? They let their operation go smoothly and then take it out on the customer.. Neat and neat. It was 6,500 won per game (Saturday at 6 p.m.) and 2,000 won in cash. I was so excited about the music that I played bowling while dancing. Weekend visit. It is more expensive than other bowling alley nearby and rail is not very satisfactory. So-so... it wasn\\'t that bad. I\\'m not a good bowler, so it was okay to hang out with friends over a beer, and the staff was kind.  But I couldn\\'t get the ball back because of the pin. I didn\\'t know that, and I rolled another ball, and it was like pooping on a clogged toilet, but I laughed a lot because of that happening.It was good to drink and play lightly. I don\\'t like it. The rails are so short that the spinders don\\'t even have a lot of houseballs.. It was nice of you to explain. The price of the drink is reasonable.. It\\'s normal.. I looked it up because I didn\\'t want to go to Hongdae, but there\\'s a bowling alley near Mapo Station, so I\\'ll make a reservation by phone and go right away! I got a college student discount and played with Jam... The lane is pretty short. I think they cut it down to put a bunch of rain in a small space. Also, it is too expensive as others say. I understand that it\\'s 6,500 won per person per game per weekend/2,000 won for a conversation, but I have to order one drink per person. I\\'ve never seen a bowling alley like this before.6000 won for an Americano... It\\'s more expensive than Starbucks.  They say that they are selling their seats with guts, but I think it\\'s too much. I don\\'t like it. On weekends, it\\'s 6,500 won for shoes, 2,000 won for shoes, and you have to order 1 drink per person. It\\'s 10,000 won for beer and 12,000 won for the rest, but it\\'s on sale. A handful of Bud 5 bottles of nachos? You give me 50,000 won... It was less than an hour, but it cost me 200,000 won for seven people.Everyone, it\\'s cheaper to take a taxi and go somewhere else, including transportation. Two frozen pizza for 20,000 won. Three bottles of beer and a plate of nachos and ketchup are 40,000 won. The game fee is 6,000 won each.  I thought it would be expensive, but three of us played for 90 minutes and it came out to 150,000 won. It is better to know that it is expensive. It\\'s one drink per person, but drinks and beer are very expensive and I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go again because of their unkindness. I went to the get-together and the atmosphere is nice! I\\'m so excited. I\\'ll go often. Surprised by the interior... Surprised by the music...I had a lot of fun. I also liked various cocktails... I like being close to work the most.. nan. Of course, people who like dogs will like it, and it\\'s comfortable because there\\'s a bed. But the taste and price of drinks and desserts are not very... Ha Se-young sometimes visits healing to cheer up. The atmosphere is nice and I\\'m raising a dog in the cafe, but it doesn\\'t smell. It\\'s comfortable~. Black Pearl Gaenojam... a sublime work that discredits the reputation of Keiscape The staff are not kind. I felt like I was bothered by the guest. The room escape dwarf theme was fun. Okay.. It\\'s the best.. The bathroom was clean and there was a separate smoking booth, so it was good. Rabokki was delicious. It\\'s nice to have more menus, I guess.  There were many old comic books and it was good. I\\'m totally satisfied. I only know cartoon room. It was good because it was easy to find at the subway entrance. The food was cheap and the taste was good. The coffee taste was okay. The facilities are good, but the employees\\' response is rubbish.. I had some time left, so I went in for a while, but it was bigger than I thought, and I came out after a long time.~~. It\\'s the best.. They said it was three 1,000 wons in the picture, but it\\'s two. It\\'s expensive. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s fun if you play with unlimited time. This is real trash.Especially, the boss wasn\\'t a real personality.I think it\\'s illegal to refuse card split payment.What are you going to do when I tell you I can\\'t?I\\'ve been patient, but I won\\'t let it pass.. Many people went, and they told me to combine all the lanes and keep asking me how many more games I\\'m going to play, and they\\'re telling me to go fast... It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. Luminous bowling from 11 p.m. 2,500 won for canned beer!. Everything\\'s good.. Nice and nice. Weekdays?The three-hour service price is 6,000 won in cash. Was it 3,000 won per hour? Beverages are between 3,000 and 6,000 won? I\\'ll go there often.. The staff is kind and nice. It hasn\\'t been long since it was built, so I think the facilities are good. I\\'ll use it often. The facilities of Ssangmun-dong bowling alley in Gangbuk-gu are also great.And the maintenance machine is completely new!!! It\\'s a new bowling alley, so it\\'s completely clean.~~. I\\'m sorry about all the story probability management. If you do it for the first time, you can save money because you don\\'t want to escape the room again. [Destroyed City] I\\'m a little disappointed in probability, story and decoration. I\\'m a little sad. The room escape cafe that I stopped by because I had a lot of places to go on a date with my girlfriend~ It\\'s very fresh and the staff is kind, so I\\'m having a good date.I\\'ll come by again later. I strongly recommend!^^b. Ha. If you go late at night, the parking lot is open, so it\\'s free and quiet. Going to Han River in spring and autumn and riding a bike~ If you have a picnic, it\\'s a great ^^ Good! Bicycling The parking lot is very small... The amount of waste is. It\\'s normal. It\\'s been a while since the weather was so nice and we went out to Han River! The weather to be clear on a clear day, the season where the blue sky and cosmos\\' colorful scenery and relaxation are reflected. As expected, hehehehe. Sometimes I feel like I come to the family unit a lot. Chicken and beer at the Han River. a playground ^^ It\\'s been a long time since the weather was so nice and we went out to Han River! The weather to be clear on a clear day, the season where the blue sky and cosmos\\' colorful scenery and relaxation are reflected. As expected, hehehehe. Sometimes I feel like I come to the family unit a lot. Chicken and beer at the Han River. a playground ^^ It\\'s quiet even in midsummer, old-fashioned guy. It\\'s normal. I laughed so hard with my friends. I barely survived. The facility is the best in Korea! The fun of bowling is different. I don\\'t know how time flies.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s a room escape cafe with no hints, so you can ask if it\\'s blocked. The kindness of the staff is usually... The price is usually... I got addicted to room escape because I did my first room escape at Last Icecape! It\\'s the best. It\\'s made up of kind service and fun themes. I recommend it!. nan. I don\\'t like it. It was much better than I thought! The oil condition of the rail is not good and the pins are cheap, so I felt that there was not enough cool taste. There are almost no balls over 14 balls. For those who are looking for heavy balls, refer to it. I came at 9:30 and they told me to go to the leftmost lane, but I didn\\'t turn off the scoreboard. I hit it once because it was so hard for me, and suddenly a female employee came and said I had to wait for an hour. When we called, he said he could hit us right away, so I asked him what he was talking about, and he said he couldn\\'t make a reservation, so he had to wait. Then shouldn\\'t you tell me in advance? I\\'ve been arguing and you won\\'t say anything. So when I went to the counter to cancel it, he said he was in the 8th lane. He said he was wrong. He didn\\'t apologize until the end. He said he didn\\'t say it. He\\'s the only one here. Cancel it because it\\'s so funny and just leave and lose about 20 minutes. ᄏAt least say sorry. Even when you cancel, you don\\'t tell us to put a card on you and just stand there until we give you a card. You know you\\'re sitting at the counter all day long like yourself. Anyway, fold the lining again.. I was tricked by the fact that I had a good blog review. Don\\'t ever! I didn\\'t clean the floor -- I recommend it to someone who likes ramen; I don\\'t want to come back anyway -- it was dirty and bad. I didn\\'t have much food to eat, and the snacks were all dried up, so I was offended. I didn\\'t have any board games or game consoles. I went to the review, and the room is small, and there\\'s nothing. ᅲᅲ. Sungnyemun Gate, National Treasure No. 1 Let\\'s get rid of the wounds and move on to the new millennium.. nan. It\\'s clean and nice.The boss was kind and had a good time without any inconvenience.May you prosper... The boss is very kind. Love. I love it because it\\'s quiet and clean! I rested well with delicious tea on a day I didn\\'t want to be disturbed.. It smells so bad, the location of the bathroom is so bad, and above all, the hygiene is so... Too many drunk, too many kickers on the wall and spit out a lot... ..clean and well-equipped. Good facilities.. nan. Employee mess. Part-timer, you\\'re rude. Heaven of Alba. If you\\'re close to Alba, you can wear sneakers without wearing bowling shoes. Even if you come here with an acquaintance, you can use 1 lane per person. If you\\'re bothered by Alba, you can make a damage joke. Thank you for your personality. I\\'m sure there\\'s a reason why business doesn\\'t go well even if you\\'re in a good position, right? If you want to maintain the bowling alley, monitor the part-timers now. You\\'ll see why business isn\\'t as good as you think. I don\\'t want to lose my grade. ;. The floor is sticky. very unfriendly I don\\'t know what to do. Even when I brought food, I just threw it away without saying anything. The food isn\\'t just great. If I were you, I\\'d skip this part. I went to see Naver review and I ate the worst pizza in my life...It\\'s like chewing plastic, and it\\'s like a frozen pizza heated. The dough is 1mm, and the cheese is 1mm, and there is no plastic cheese at all, and it\\'s just big. No taste at all. E-mart pizza, pizza school is 100 times better, beer is just... beer is good. No beer, no pizza, no. It\\'s normal. Unkindness. It\\'s normal. It\\'s good to drink beer. It\\'s a good pizza and beer place! All right, all right. All right, all right. Pizza is delicious. It\\'s a little loud. It\\'s normal. Okay. A place where you can drink handmade beer at a very low price. Not long after the opening, the people were good, the pizza quality wasn\\'t bad, and the table wasn\\'t very close...Maybe it\\'s because of the good business, but when I went there recently, I put the table next to me close enough to say it\\'s a joint table, and pizza comes out for the second time after ordering, but the quality is worse than it used to be. Well, if I knew it wasn\\'t a good idea to just increase the number of tables...Folding. Good. Pizza is not as good as other pizza and beer restaurants, but this place is good because it has a fresh and delicious salad and you can drink handmade beer at a reasonable price.  Beer is the same price regardless of type, except for the stuffy underground, I think salad is also plentiful for the price. It\\'s normal. It\\'s perfect for an ambiguous price and taste of pizza and beer. High quality. Not for those who want it. It\\'s normal. It\\'s perfect for an ambiguous price and taste of pizza and beer. High quality. Not for those who want it.. There are a lot of fun and diverse board games and it\\'s great! I had a lot of fun! I think I\\'ll only go to Gangnam room cafe here!!!. It\\'s the best.. I\\'ve been to other places, but I liked it because there were many themes! I thought it would be unreasonable because there were many themes, but it was more fun than expected and the staff was nice. I was so happy that the people working were so kind! The facilities were clean and I was frustrated at first because I was wearing a mask, but I forgot to wear a mask later on. LOL It\\'s so much fun.It\\'s very well-organized and I\\'ve been to Hongdae, and there are many room escape cafes that don\\'t clean up. The Maze was clean.It\\'s a good place to hang out with your boyfriend because it\\'s cold these days and there is nothing to do outside.~~bb :^). It was cold, so I had no worries. It was fun. It was good! When it\\'s hot and you don\\'t deserve it, you should definitely go!. nan. The theme is fun and clean without old things. Best, best, best, best! Room Escape after Nowon The Maze and Kuhon XCape!!! A murder case in a private high school is a must. Even the problems that are too good for beginners, I love the stories that fit each characteristic. I find the point attractive. The level of difficulty is reasonable~~~~ It\\'s not been long since it opened~~ It was nice because it was clean and well managed.More than anything! Story and interior!!! Good. Good. Interior good.. Okay.. It\\'s the best. I wasn\\'t sure but I searched for it. The part-timers were very kind. Maybe it\\'s changed. My boyfriend and my friends go and have fun together. There\\'s nothing like a board game cafe when you play indoors, especially Jamsil, so I recommend this place. There is no place to put in Jamsil, but it was fun to play board games after a long time and there are a lot of games. I don\\'t like it.. I often go around, but it was okay. Good because you can go to a clean and clean facility anytime. I used to go there often, but suddenly the price was raised to two songs for 1,000 won. I was so surprised today that I just came out... It\\'s so expensive that low stars.... It\\'s a place where you can talk about restful storage. Relaxed. I came to take a break because I have free time. The owner is so kind and comfortable. I think I fell asleep for a while. I hope I can recover from fatigue. The boss is so kind. I suddenly felt sick, I couldn\\'t go home, and I wanted to lie down for an hour...I rested really well. Thank you so much to me. I lied down to sleep in the lounge and turned on the music so I couldn\\'t sleep. It\\'s a little tight.. It was clean and nice on the weekend!  Chicken mayo is delicious! I recommend going on weekdays. There are too many people on weekends. It\\'s the best. I like it because it\\'s clean. And chocolate latte and chicken mayo are really delicious. It\\'s hard to go to a cafe in the back of this street. You can park here. I found it and it\\'s too much. Going out to a cafe with my girlfriend is delicious.~~~~. It\\'s normal. It was the cleanest cartoon cafe I\\'ve ever been to. I enjoyed watching it comfortably and funly. A hidden attraction. It\\'s the best.. I went to the weekend opening, and I went to the 10:30 p.m. opening, and there were no employees and the staff who came out were very unfriendly, so I felt bad. You\\'re so blunt that I thought I did something wrong. The boss is kind. All right. Complain response is slow. employees are rude. It is neat and you can see a cat. It was comfortable because popular cartoons were written by rank, and there were three cats. It was so cute. I read comic books in a comfortable space.The boss is kind, too.^^. You\\'ll know when you go. The food is delicious. There\\'s a lot of trendy cartoons.. Well, this is the origin of Sincheon right now!. It\\'s the best.. I\\'ve been there several times and it\\'s cost-effective and tastes great. All the food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice~! The bosses are so handsome, cost-effective, and the atmosphere is the best!! :). It is neat and the beer is delicious. The food, the cocktail is really delicious and the boss\\'s kindness!! Good good. The facilities are really good.. The two-track facility is not bad for 1,000 won, but I think it\\'s in this price range because it\\'s only here.. It\\'s really nice because it\\'s clean. I can feel that you\\'re paying attention to the scent of the blanket and cleanliness. There are a lot of new books. There\\'s a lot of books. The owner is kind and the comic book cafe is comfortable, so it\\'s good to take a nap. I like that webtoons and cartoons are updated quickly. I often go with my girlfriend. The room is neat. The food is so good that it doesn\\'t come out well inside.The location is so good that there are too many people on weekends. ᅲ You have to wait a while to go to the bathroom. The latest one is in 2015.... It\\'s a room escape cafe with no hints, so you can ask if it\\'s blocked. The kindness of the staff is usually... The price is usually... I got addicted to room escape because I did my first room escape at Last Icecape! It\\'s the best. It\\'s made up of kind service and fun themes. I recommend it!. Not managed at all Dirty. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s not Seodaemun Station, it\\'s a park next to Independence Gate Station. Good. It\\'s the best.. I\\'m sorry about all the story probability management. If you do it for the first time, you can save money because you don\\'t want to escape the room again. [Destroyed City] I\\'m a little disappointed in probability, story and decoration. I\\'m a little sad. The room escape cafe that I stopped by because I had a lot of places to go on a date with my girlfriend~ It\\'s very fresh and the staff is kind, so I\\'m having a good date.I\\'ll come by again later. I strongly recommend!^^b. nan. I visited with my friends, and I loved the friendly game description and the bright cafe atmosphere. ^^. It\\'s the best. I\\'m a little sad. It\\'s delicious, so I drink one or two glasses, and it\\'s so delicious. Please bring your boyfriends and girlfriends since the atmosphere is nice. I drank alone because I didn\\'t have one. I like the atmosphere, the atmosphere is good, the alcohol is good, the boss is good, the darts are good.. Hon-te-me was really fun!. It\\'s good to chat because it\\'s quiet even though it\\'s Gangnam. A quiet, studyable, distinctive cafe. Okay, it\\'s normal. The atmosphere is good, even though it is Gangnam on the weekend, it is very quiet.. I loved it. The boss is kind. There\\'s a compartment with an electric pad. There was a blanket and it was cold in the evening, so I could go and rest well!. One song for 500 won or three minutes for 500 won. No guests. If you\\'re looking for a karaoke room where you can always go in, here. ⏺⏹⏏⏯◀⏪⏮⏫⏬⏸▶⏩⏭. Microphone in every room is in a mess. Even if you lower the echo, it\\'s the worst because it\\'s buzzing. Besides, the microphone stinks badly. The room size is seriously small. Up to Gusan, Eungam, Bulgwang, Nokbeon, this neighborhood is the worst.. It\\'s the best. Mix the best cheese with the kimbbokbap. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~! a little bit of a restaurant. As expected, it was fun!! I can\\'t wait to do the other one! Banklub and Kim Sun had so much fun! I\\'m looking forward to the upcoming bell pepper and SOS!. The store is so pretty. The facilities are good and it would be nice to hang out with friends or go on a date. The atmosphere is amazing. There are many photo zones and bowling alley, but there are many other things to play and see! It\\'s nice. I had a lot of fun. The service and facilities are good It\\'s expensive, so it\\'s perfect to hang out with friends and have a drink. If you\\'re blinded by money, just drink the leftover beverage at the table. First spring employee or part-time worker, the person who receives money is also not good. I\\'ve never seen anything like this before. . . .I don\\'t like it because it\\'s so pretentious. unkindness to the staff The first visit also failed to use the coupon (no such notice and no residual counseling). 15,000 won for a glass of beer. ᄃᄃ 4 4 people played a game of bowling and 100,000 won. The facilities are good but too expensive.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s neat. Wireless microphones, microphone covers, and card payments are available. It\\'s spacious, it\\'s comfortable, it\\'s clean in the bathroom, and it\\'s just a coin karaoke room near my house.. nan. I haven\\'t done it a few times, but it\\'s fun. I think it\\'d be nice if several people did it. I don\\'t like room escape as punishment, but when I went there, I was satisfied. The staff were so kind! It was a little difficult, but I should try an easy theme next time! All right, the facilities are old, so if you don\\'t press it, it won\\'t work, and if you go there for the first time, you don\\'t say you can\\'t do it, but when you sit down and wait, people who are calling for hints say you can\\'t do it after hanging up...I did a room with four stars, but it\\'s too much. I feel bad~~ You have to use the lantern from beginning to end because there is no other device at all.. It\\'s like a cartoon cafe, but actually a good restaurant. The facilities are so neat and cozy. The menu is good, the comic book is clean, and the boss is very kind. Please recommend something to read since the books are snooping around. It is comfortable with air purifier. Everyone, this is the best comic book store!  Ramen is so delicious and more than anything, the space is so wide!  With such a large private space, it feels like I\\'m reading a cartoon in my room!  Above all, turn on the air conditioner so full that I really don\\'t regret it!!  And it was really nice of you to be so kind!!. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s so humid in the basement and it smells like mold.The bathroom is so dirty and the games are so old that some of the components are missing. The staff were very kind, but the facilities were really bad, and I didn\\'t want to stay long. I don\\'t know how to play board games, but the staff told me right away if I was confused or didn\\'t know anything. It was my first time going there today and it was fun and good. Have a good time. Oh, and I\\'m so happy that the female staff in red clothes who helped us with our board game and paid for us on the way. Please be kind. I will go there again if I have time. I\\'m going to play a code name, but if it\\'s a game that four people can play, it could be ambiguous. But I said it\\'s okay, and I said I\\'ve played it before, so what are you asking me to explain? Is there a part-timer here to explain?Then should I explain all the games I know to my friends...? The first employee you explained to me was very kind. I don\\'t want to go again.I know I\\'m too lazy to explain the code name because I\\'m working part-time at board games, but I don\\'t think I\\'m asking you to explain it to me because I don\\'t want to.Folding. You can\\'t see it in the picture, but there are quite a few corners, and this part is forced to make a double layer, so the head can touch the ceiling. And it\\'s damp underground, it smells a little bit, and up to here, it\\'s a mess of the rules. Maybe it\\'s because it\\'s a minor game, but I think it would have been nice if we could find a manual inside and print it out.. Facility management is the worst. I should have played only 1 game, but I thought I was going to get a lung disease after 2 games. I don\\'t want to waste a single star. I\\'m throwing a ball, and they\\'re telling me to get out of the way because I\\'m cleaning it all of a sudden, but even if you\\'re digging, it\\'s not friendly and it\\'s only run by clubs. I don\\'t think the general public cares. I came here to hit my shoes several times, but I was really upset and came out just once. It\\'s cheap. I won\\'t go again. Absolute base. When bowling in Myeong-dong, ~24:00. Good. It smells like mold and is very unsanitary in old buildings.  The ball is dirty; it\\'s as if she\\'s not taking care of it; she\\'s reluctant to put on her shoes;; there\\'s no table to put her cell phone or drink.  It\\'s a mess because there are some tourists and customers. Hahlam and Malam?I can\\'t believe you\\'re such a garbage man.~LOL. There are many criminals listed on the sex offender notification list around here, so they are not used well. It\\'s good for a walk. YUEO Found. That\\'s great!. Five cartels of fun escaped with five minutes left. I really liked it because it was neat and I liked it more because it was kind!I had so much fun on the cloudy day of my last life.^^~ I\\'m going to try a cartel next time. I\\'ll trust you on the neck I graduated from my long-awaited journey. Cartels were a real hobby! Really active! I like the interior, too. I strongly recommend it. The cartel and cloudy days were so much fun! And the memory...Thriller? That\\'s too much.Congratulations on your graduation!. The boss is kind and the facilities are clean and nice. He\\'s kind and nice! But can\\'t you do it until 1 a.m.? On weekends. The boss is so kind and clean! a regular for years a clear space  I don\\'t understand the malicious comments below, so I leave comments. The owner is kind and he has a lot of cartoons.. Massage me! The owner is kind! Above all, the massager was luxurious and comfortable. The interior was fine. It\\'s nice to be able to relax.The ^bbbb cafe is neat and the owners are kind.  The massage chair is very nice. Great effect!! There are many drinks and especially the tea is luxurious.  Where do you want to go again? I strongly recommend it! I went to Sinchon to rest for a while. I liked the massage machine because it didn\\'t hurt and it was cool.  There are many kinds of organic tea and coffee, so it\\'s fun to choose from. The interior is bright and bright, so it feels warm.  Just like the name of the cafe, I got refreshed. I recommend it.. Ah, the lane is narrow and it\\'s a miracle calculation. You said it was 6,500 won at first, but the payment was 7,000 won each, so I called you and asked you, and you were annoyed and just said no. I don\\'t know if you can\\'t say it well.I see why the stars are so bad.All u ppl that dnt knw the normal price dnt go here. It is all very 4,000~ for a place it is this place for a place it is 7,000 per game and they make u pay a 2500 fee for brooding shoes. I saw it in the early morning and walked there. Are you kidding me? Four bottles of beer are 25,000 won, four 10,000 won for conversation, four for two rounds of 5,000 won. Don\\'t sell like a thug when the price tag is attached. It\\'s so nice to write a message so that you can see it with one eye. The staff members are so kind. We\\'re having fun. 3 games for 10,000 won~ I\\'m happy~~~. The facilities are good, but there are not enough comic books. I wasted my time looking for a book because I didn\\'t have anything to read.. Alba = unfriendly enough to fall within five fingers of a Hongdae establishment. It\\'s not blunt, it\\'s just like picking a fight. Facilities = The unique smell of mold, bathroom, and star smell are all left. Guitar = I broke my glass by mistake, and I was told to pay back mercilessly. Don\\'t go. The worst cocktail bar I\\'ve ever been to, only female cocktail makers wear masks and serving staff don\\'t even wear masks -- and there\\'s a worker who says he\\'s fever, but he doesn\\'t know why he came to work, and he doesn\\'t use a mezer cup when making cocktails, and he makes his own phone and makes it taste dirty and just uses it. Why are you so cheap? The store is full of dusty cobwebs all over the place to see if you don\\'t even clean. It smells like a bathroom because it\\'s underground. It usually tastes like water in a cocktail. Go to another unlimited refill cocktail restaurant. I used to go there often, but I became too unfriendly. Relieved. I thought you were a part-timer or an employee. It\\'s an unlimited cocktail, but I felt uncomfortable ordering it. I\\'m so unkind that I don\\'t want to go again. I can\\'t even see handmade burgers more than half of the menu because the boss is away during the week...That\\'s why I went... Although I expressed my regret, I am planning to go out and buy some snacks thanks to the part-timers who can\\'t communicate with my boss.. Karaoke is very good.And there is no phone number and there is no way to contact you, so I am contacting you like this.I\\'ll make sure to put the microphone back after work today.I\\'m sorry. I drank too much yesterday. I\\'m sorry again.. It\\'s really pretty here when the cherry blossoms bloom. Long time no see. Asia Park... A park that often takes a walk at home because it\\'s a limited subway home. It\\'s small but has a lot of grass and trees are big and dense. Especially the pictures taken with yellow ginkgo trees and nice streetlights in the fall are British.. I don\\'t like it. It\\'s the best!!!    Dalchang, Beopjeongjoppa, a clean shop without a seat, I went after lunch on Saturday and it was nice because there were no people. There was a table tennis table and billiard table in the waiting room, so it was good to play in various ways. I didn\\'t like the grease so I took two rounds to adjust to the rail. Service failure, counter unkindness, lane and houseball are not managed, never again lining, rather than going to the Gangnam branch of Smashing Ball at Sinnonhyeon Station. It was really fun to bowl because there were no people during the daytime on weekdays. There are bright and dark places, but dark places are much more fun. Other than bowling alley, there is a table tennis table or pocket ball, so it\\'s good for bowling and playing.I joined a bowling club and went around here. It\\'s so much fun.The president of the club said that the lane is good and the facilities are good!  I\\'m really bad at bowling, but it\\'s so much fun. Everyone carries around their own ball. I\\'m still a beginner, so I\\'m using this. It\\'s good!. I don\\'t know how many errors there are in one game. It\\'s one drink per person, and the price is one game bowling. The bowling alley is awsome but the manager or supervisor seems clearly abuse of his step.. Last night we saw a team member being very much by his supervisor on the bar - please console this when deciding where to blow, but the manager or supervisor clearly seems to be abusing the employees. Last night we saw a team member at a bar verbally abusing his boss. Please consider this when deciding where to put the bowl!Folding. Not as busy as I thought.. It rained so much that I ordered chicken pizza with my friends and went to play, and I was really satisfied.The biggest advantage of being able to take outside food! I liked it better because all the drinks were unlimited. The employees and the boss are so kind and the price is reasonable! Visit doctor 100! However, I hope you didn\\'t spray too much air freshener when cleaning up.. He\\'s so nice, he\\'s got a lot of books and he\\'s clean.  Baby guests, if it\\'s noisy, we don\\'t have to go talk to them. It\\'s nice because they seem to be considerate of other people. They clean up right away and the food is delicious.. I went to the stars\\' store ○ Why is it created? The screen input kept changing. (Average 7 times per song) I couldn\\'t memorize the lyrics, so I turned on the lyrics on my phone. ○○. It\\'s neat, but...It\\'s too expensive. The sudden change from four to two songs for 1,000 won.. The boss almost muzzled me and told me to play bowling, a place called bowling, like in the library... so unkind... The boss is unkind. The facilities here are so bad and unkind. The ball won\\'t roll. The ball is also very bad. They don\\'t even accept credit cards after 11.. nan. It\\'s the best. It\\'s so much fun.King Wang Zzang Recommendation. under construction. Good night. It\\'s cozy, clean and... It\\'s a place where the boss is really good at managing.. It\\'s the best.. I\\'m a little sad.. It\\'s the best.. Your mother and father are very kind.If you go early, it\\'s 1,000 won for 5 songs, so the cost-effectiveness is the best! If you get 100 points for 1,000 won for 5 songs as an event, you\\'ll get one more song. You\\'re the best. You were so kind. I liked the sound system of the wireless microwaves and the teasers.. nan. The highest price of sound in the surrounding coin singing rooms is 500 won, but there are two songs here. It\\'s the best.. The fee is very cheap, but the environment is the worst.It\\'s hard to use it for an hour because the air is cloudy and stenchy.. More than 30,000 books, including a cheap fare system and a cave room for comfortable sofa couples.. I moved around and looked for a place nearby first. I think Sambo here is the perfect place to go with the children. I like the facilities and the price, and above all, the employees are so kind that I went bowling happily. Oh, my God! I\\'ve discovered a whole new world. I was so busy raising my kids that I got together with my college classmates and they\\'re all relieved of their stress!I made an appointment to see you again next month. It\\'s been a while since I had so much fun!!!LOL I\\'m right in front of my house, so I play bowling a lot with my friends for fun. The boss is kind and now I go there often, so I think I go there more often because they recognize me as a regular customer. I\\'m having a good time every time I go there often with my friends, and the facilities are so nice.lol lol lol I think I should go this week.I recommend it. Located in the eastern market of Jungwha-dong.These days, the place is decorated with glow-in-the-dark and has a lot of fun with exciting music. It\\'s a fun place to go bowling, except that it\\'s a little far from my neighborhood. Rock bowling... The reason why I like glow-in-the-dark bowling is because it\\'s exciting and fun. It\\'s near the eastern market and it\\'s good to go with my friends sometimes. It\\'s not close to my neighborhood because it\\'s Myeonmok-dong, but I think it\\'s the best place to go rock bowling! There aren\\'t many rock bowling alley... Oh, I was going to go bowling in Myeonmok-dong a while ago.Why didn\\'t you come here then? I\\'ll be there next time. I was looking for a bowling alley. The music is exciting and shiny. I heard there\\'s a rock bowling alley in Gangnam. I heard that there\\'s a rock bowling alley in Jungnang-gu. It\\'s clean and nice, maybe because it\\'s been refurbished. Shoes are glow-in-the-dark and the sense of spraying Febreze with new ones. I love it.I was wondering if rock bowling was far away and it was glow-in-the-dark bowling? That\\'s how I looked for the glow-in-the-dark bowling alley.I didn\\'t know there was so much information here.I\\'m going to play soon. I didn\\'t know there was a rock bowling alley in Myeonmok-dong.I\\'ll have to visit you soon. It\\'s rare to find a place like this. I wanted to play field bowling.I was looking for it, and I went... I think it\\'s good to stop by regardless of the time. It\\'s late-night business, so I went after the company dinner...It\\'s so good to go at night!!!!!! Wow!. Good, good. The phone number of the Gloa cartoon cafe is wrong. Call 02-852-7101. ^^. Usually, it\\'s too dirty. Sometimes it\\'s not organized at all, and the remote control and microphone are so dirty and greasy that I feel uncomfortable. I\\'m not going to go next time. It\\'s the best.. The missions left by anonymous agents are hidden here and there. It must be done. (Gulgwi haha). It\\'s the best.. It\\'s funny, but I give you 5 points because you have a low rating. 2 points are not for sure. About 3.5 to 4? I can\\'t see the hint that you managed the props roughly and I can\\'t even see if they\\'re props or not. The room escape by the lock for the lock is really... The more easily I solve the unconvincing problems, the more I\\'m disappointed, the more money I waste. Room escape is of high quality. This is one of the most sloppy places I\\'ve ever been to. It\\'s a totally improbable story. Okay.. The only coin karaoke in town is nice and easy. The part-time job at midnight is so rude. It\\'s good because you can pay with an unmanned card. The microphone music echo volume setting is a bit different for each room, so please adjust it and control the sound quality of your speakers. Please modify the opening deadline on Naver.. The room escape itself was very well made. Is it because of the large scale and the large number of customers? Although it was regrettable that there were many employees at the counter, it was not organized, but the story was still solid compared to other half escape, and the various themes were unique, so it was definitely Roomz. Usually, people go up to the fourth floor after receiving payment and guidance in the basement. The basement was much wider than I thought. There are board games and drinks and snacks. What\\'s regrettable is that there are many part-timers, but they don\\'t teach them much. Everyone does not deviate far from the desk radius and informs it only by beckoning. So I asked a lot; what are you doing over there? You can just go up. in this way So I\\'ll give you 3 stars. The part-timers on the fourth floor were nice. Explain in detail the problems you don\\'t know. Also, what\\'s disappointing is that it\\'s a bit more expensive than the average room escape price? I think it was 1.8~20,000 won, but it was 220,000 won here. (Based on my theme) Still, I\\'ll be a room escape fan. I\\'m a little sad. It\\'s the best. The store is spacious and the staff is kind. There is a good board game, too. It was the most fun since Pilhwal is famous.. There were not many types of balls, especially 9-10 pounds, and it was hard to find holes for women to hit.  To say that the ball was managed well, the ball\\'s thumb is worn out and it hurts so much. It\\'s more expensive than anywhere else, but I\\'m so annoyed that I let go of it by telling everyone to hit me.. These days, all the rental shops are gone, but they keep renting here, so I use them often. Thank you for giving me energy in my exam life. I didn\\'t know what it was, but I wonder what it is. The product description is required.. 1.Rain management is better than other bowling alleys.  2. The owners are very young compared to the bowling alley. You can see people in various forms. 3. Location and parking are very convenient. You\\'ll know when you go. The staff is so rude. Where did you learn that? an employee\\'smanNo. Flipped while hitting the floor. Rental shoes are so tight that they don\\'t get pushed back at all; and I don\\'t want to touch them because they\\'re so dirty with a bandage attached to a house ball.. There are a lot of themes and I\\'m really into it, so when I come to Daehakro, I\\'ll definitely have to come back here.I went to the escape room with my friends and the story is interesting here.I had a comedy with my friends.I think I go here once a month with my girlfriend. I like this place because it has the cleanest facilities and a lot of food! The story is also interesting, so I\\'m getting immersed. I\\'m going to try a different version next time. It was my first time to go to an escape room. I used a weekend discount and it was so much fun that I think I would go there often. Haha. nan. There aren\\'t many kinds of genuine comic books. It was cheap and good. Okay.. The staff are all sitting down, they\\'re playing board games, they\\'re louder than people, and they\\'re too dark to press the button to change, they don\\'t want to do it. The only advantage is clean, pretty design.. nan. A strange family is awesome. Really, but there was a lock open in the middle. I couldn\\'t get out of the game because the stuff I needed to solve the problem wasn\\'t properly arranged.No matter how many times I searched, I tried to ask, but I couldn\\'t because I didn\\'t have an interphone.; I complained after it was over, but I didn\\'t like it because you just laughed away.I won\\'t go again. Love maker. . . . . Love maker theme is not good. Hints are not intercoms, but came out of my laptop and didn\\'t come out properly, so I was looking for them for 30 minutes and couldn\\'t do anything.. Is it that hard to open the door and have a third-quarter leg while singing? You\\'re so rude. At first, he didn\\'t tell me what time it was, but he kept insisting that he had told me, but I sang it in a bad mood and hung up and left. I\\'m annoyed. I heard it was open 24 hours a day, so I went past 3 a.m., but it turned out it was open 24 hours a day only on weekends, right? Business hours confuse consumers.. It\\'s not like any other room escape. It\\'s so much fun. It was amazing that we chose a character and solved the problem. The staff is kind and very funny!! I didn\\'t want to waste money. The sound, puzzle, and interior are all so real that it\\'s so immersive. It was scary in the middle, but it was fun.Seribrum is fun! I strongly recommend! I\\'ll do something else next time. Unlike other escape rooms, the facilities were clean and it was fun because there were many electronic devices! I strongly recommend it. Although I couldn\\'t escape the room.It was so much fun. The masters are kind and the room is big~ I strongly recommend it! ^^. The devices and structures are amazing! And I saw Hong Jin-ho. He\\'s a successful fan. I\\'ve been to a room escape brand. It\\'s been a while since I did well-made room escape. You can choose the level of difficulty, so beginners are okay, but if you\\'ve tried it before, just do it. You\\'re an orphan even if you don\\'t eat it! It\\'s so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🌿🌺🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀. It\\'s my first time doing room escape with my friends. The quality is better than I thought. The staff members are very kind to explain.^^I should try again with a higher level of difficulty!! It\\'s my first time doing a room escape game. It\\'s so much fun. I want to try it again. Breakoutscape good good. We did room escape three times, and the level of difficulty was flat, but it was so much fun!! I did Hawkers 1 and there is Hawkers 2, so I will definitely come with my friends! It\\'s so much fun that I want to do it as soon as I get the chance. But since it\\'s a reservation system, I\\'m leaving with tears in my eyes...For those who like the difficult level, it may be easy, so please refer to that.It\\'s fun~~ It\\'s very fun for a couple to come and play. The theme is rich and realistic. I think it was more fun because the staff were very kind and explained the theme realistically. If you come to Hongdae, make sure to visit. It was my first time to do room escape. It was the easiest Hawks, but it was fun to feel immersed in finding a real magician! Like board games, there is also the role of host, which is an important factor in solving the game. It\\'s a room escape game that everyone can enjoy regardless of whether they like it or not! We\\'re going to have fun~ It was my first time doing room escape, and it was so much fun! It was the easiest game, but it\\'s not easy for me.The staff were so kind that I could have a fun experience. I want to come back again and succeed in escaping. You did a great job.It\\'s fun. Hawkers 1 succeeded, Hawkers 2 failed at the end...Breakout escape was so new and so fresh. The problem was so hard that I had to work on it.I\\'m going to try another episode next time. It\\'s so exciting. I couldn\\'t break it, but the composition of the problem was very good! It was the funniest and most difficult escape so far, but it was interesting to have a story. I came to Seoul from Gochang!!!Room Escape, as great as Hong Jin-ho\\'s reputation! If you want a fresh room escape, breakout escape Hongik University!We give you this. The suspicious oriental medicine concept is so good and it\\'s really exciting. Time went by quickly because I was so into it. Wow, I think I\\'ve done it more than X10 times.Sometimes I\\'m in agony, but it\\'s that much fun. I\\'ll be back next time to wake up Seribrum!!!Breakout...Seeing more. It was refreshing and fun to see each character\\'s. After listening to it, I think I can do better next time!!! I think it\\'s better to be with friends. I\\'ll be back next time. I\\'ve fallen for you!It was more complicated than I thought, so it was fun!!I was a little scared to open the door.I will come back with my friends next time! The quality is different from other places! I have my own job, so I don\\'t know what kind of room it is before I go in, but I can build my own strategy, so I get more immersed in the game. And there are simple problem solving, but there are active forms so it is not boring!! I strongly recommend it.

It\\'s fun. It was a new experience. Two suspicious oriental medicine doctors did it, but it was hard but fun! There is no forced problem and it is easy to solve without complexity because it is solved sequentially. As soon as I entered the room, I could smell red and herbal medicine like oriental medicine, but it was more fun because I was immersed in it I came here with my friends to try it once, and the next day I came back to do the second round!!! It\\'s so much fun. I\\'m going to try everything! Hocus one or two in two days! I was surprised because the staff were so kind and guided me well. I\\'ll try again next time! It\\'s so much fun. I couldn\\'t escape, but I want to come back! It\\'s exciting and fun!! Hocus two! There was a part that surprised me in the middle, but it was fun. To give you a tip, you should wear comfortable clothes for 2! No perfume. It\\'s so much fun. I think the story of the Seribrum theme is solid and fun. It was a lot of fun! It was very new to get hints because I was uniquely empowered! I was so happy that I didn\\'t wear a blindfold when I entered the theme. I came on a date with my girlfriend, and the atmosphere was so nice and the staff was very kind. I did a suspicious oriental medicine theme, but the problem was a little difficult, but you kindly gave me a hint so I could easily solve it!! It was so much fun.I\\'ll be back! It\\'s a hot place in Hongdae. I\\'ve played Hocus. Awesome! I\\'ll have to play all the other games. Unlike other room escape rooms, the interior and story are solid. If the existing room escape was a place where you can solve various problems, breakout is a place where you can enjoy strategic games using puzzles and character skills connected to Story. I think it\\'s a hot topic in Hongdae these days! Room Escape is so much fun. There\\'s a lot of themes. I think it would be nice if your friend came and did it. The boss is so pretty. Play using your character\\'s ability and it\\'s fresh! So much fun! I strongly recommend the Hocus magician\\'s room is fun. Compared to other Hongdae room escape, it is much more fun and intrigues me.~^^직원The staff explains it slowly and well. I\\'ll go again next time. Unlike other places, the Storia puzzle is closely connected and the interior is great. Haha. I like the taste of coffee, but I don\\'t know if it\\'s an employee or a boss or an old lady.You\\'ve done your nails well, but if you think it\\'s going to come off well...It\\'s not like you\\'re wearing gloves. If you\\'ve worked at a cafe for a long time, you don\\'t do your nails that often, but the boss looks like a novice. I don\\'t want to go again.. Okay.. If you\\'re watching this, please train the staff. I went to the room escape in a good mood and came here because of the staff. It was the most fun place I\\'ve ever been to. I don\\'t think It\\'s just nice. Maybe it\\'s because I didn\\'t ask for a hint.ᄏLaughing while waiting, eating snacks and engineers\\' theme, if there\\'s no crazy code. The employees are unfriendly. The facilities are fine. I went early because it was a morning discount, so I can\\'t get a drink or other service. (Other time users can use it) I have to pay all the original fee and only pay in cash... I think you should have told me about the payment method and the restrictions. I agree with Mr. Impulse\\'s review. Everyone else was kind, but the employee who gave me a hint while receiving the intercom at the counter! I thought you wanted to fight because you hate me so much. The employees are so unfriendly. No basic service mind. I\\'m rather trying to fight a guest because I can\\'t treat you badly. There are a lot of good reviews of Code K, but if you promote your blog, they give you a lot of discounts, so I have no choice but to do it. Don\\'t be fooled! Go to the Gangnam branch of the Seoul Icecape Room.. The price is a bit expensive and the ball is generally not in good condition.On top of that, he told me to play ball, but I had to call Alba and the president from time to time.They just let me out right away on the day I went.I think it\\'s better than the others below, but I\\'m sure it\\'s not even recommended.There\\'s not much bowling alley around here, so you can think of it as rolling.. I love it! There are a lot of books and food is delicious. This is a good place to play with people who have been to many places. It\\'s good here. I don\\'t understand why I gave you 1 point. It\\'s the best forest I\\'ve ever been to. It\\'s perfect for a date! The cost-effectiveness is good and there are many kinds of books, so it\\'s great! I don\\'t like it.. It\\'s a karaoke room with a salty score. The facilities are good and clean. The boss is kind and the facilities are clean.. All kinds of books used to be tiger cigarettes are 90 percent and 10 percent new books are new, but new books are not released very quickly and there are not many books. First of all, it wasn\\'t clean and there were many foods that weren\\'t allowed. Thanks to a kind part-timer, I had a good time from the weekend morning.I often go to this place with my boyfriend. We eat and look around and there are many different kinds of books that we like. Actually, I go to see a comic book called Crayon Shinzzang, but it\\'s a place to heal me for a cup of ice amo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~? Personally, I think it\\'s the best forest to play with, so I often use it. Every time I go, I come out after a whole day.. He\\'s really unkind, but he\\'s good at rolling balls. unfriendly, unkind, unkind There are so many people that we have a variety of table tennis, game machines, etc. for waiting guests, but the employee\\'s speech and facial expressions are ruining everything. Zero stars. I was unkind when I played the game, but I just hit it and paid for it, but later I checked the card details and it was a shame.Three of us had to pay 7,000 won each, but we paid 21,000 won each. He didn\\'t apologize at all for saying that he made a mistake on the receipt, and he just kept repeating, \"Come to the store if you want your money back.\" You\\'re kidding me-- take your shit first and do business. He\\'s so... so... so... so... so... Learn manners again. I don\\'t need all the part-timers to be kind, but since it\\'s their first time, they threw the ball wrong and came back to roll at that time before it went down, but they\\'re talking shit.lol lol never go again. It\\'s normal. It\\'s not going to be good. I just went with my family and relatives because it is the Chuseok holiday. It\\'s a waste of even a point. The employees, including the president, are so rude. If you want to feel dirty before you even play bowling, make sure to visit. ^ ^. The staff here is so rude. Oh, my God. Does the head of the bowling alley know this? I can\\'t find any kindness. It\\'s a place like this. I\\'d like you to train your staff well. People who go with me often ask me why I\\'m so rude. Last time, I asked politely if I could give you a ping-pong racket, and he shouted, \"Oh, I don\\'t have a ping-pong racket.\" He thought he was busy and angry, but he never goes next time. Ask them to leave the room as if they were favoring regulars. If you want to receive professional bowlers only, I want you to write professional welcome on the sign... That\\'s the worst behavior you can do without apologizing.. It\\'s not that good, but it\\'s terribly expensive. Oh, honestly, I don\\'t have a fan and air conditioner in this weather. I\\'ve been there since winter, but the boss seems really cheap.  I\\'ve never seen a bowling alley this hot. Since everyone next to me is hot and hot, turn on the air conditioner... No answer. It\\'s such a waste of stars. Only the interior is new and bowling facilities are not good at all. The number of bowling balls was significantly small, the lane had a problem, so I asked for maintenance four times, and the rain wasn\\'t managed, so I didn\\'t slip even wearing bowling shoes, but the weekend price was very expensive.. nan. I\\'ve been worried because I couldn\\'t find it on the search list. It\\'s good to have a round-the-year-round Saturday and Sunday except for rainy December and January. The nearby Danghyeoncheon Stream is also close, so the Polly Playground is good next to it. Children\\'s rental fee is free and you can practice with your bike! It\\'s a bummer. Okay. I heard you\\'re going to Nowon Police Station on charges of assaulting Mr. Oh, who works at the bike rental center. ᄃᄃᄃ 책임져야 할 사람 좀 있겠군. Nine-point children\\'s playground! a double-decker slide I like different amusement facilities that children will like, such as wooden roads. The best playground for children whose name is so cute. Second floor height slide, mini pond fountain and fun wooden road are so nice. However, please pay a little attention to cleaning and install more benches for parents. I want to give you nine points.. It is good to climb a mountain simply. Small but famous celebrities didn\\'t come...The perfect place to cheer for...The opposite side of the screen is the hill...Where it naturally became a terraced chair...I also want to go to the wall cheering spot.. The facilities are clean, the sound is good, and the price is really cheap!!Five songs for 1,000 won!In addition, the boss is very, very kind.If you don\\'t have cash, you can change it to an account transfer.Make sure to go here for Noryangjin Cono!! It\\'s just very good. The air is fresh and the sound is good on the second floor. Oh, and it\\'s good to rest while singing comfortably. The facilities are clean and the sound is good.^^. It\\'s.. It\\'s so nice.. Cono here has the best facilities and cleanliness! I\\'m here with my girlfriend and she says it\\'s clean and cost-effective. I like the clean and fresh interior, the spacious space, and the latest sound facilities.It\\'s also close to the station.. It\\'s spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is also clean! The staff is unkind.. 젛 Many menus are not closed; it\\'s in A-dong, so check carefully, it\\'s closed.. I like it because it\\'s so delicious and cozy. Comic books are easy to read. It\\'s good to see because they\\'re cheap. It also has a large parking space. Sometimes I read comic books and go to lunch, and I love it because it\\'s cozy.  Especially, I liked that there were many webtoons. I watched all of them. ᄏ The owner here is so kind, and the parking was 3 hours and 4,000 won, so it was hard to find it, but from the second time, I found it quickly. The price is great. I go there often these days.. Two songs for 1,000 won. The sound of the facilities here is great. It was a shame you weren\\'t in Itaewon! The facilities are clean and great!!. I was thinking of a simple one here, quality, probability, and the smallest and least quality room escape of all time.  It was like making a room escape with something in your house. It was the hardest thing to chew. Why did you pay this money when you wake up? The part-timer Hyun Ta-ohm was tired, so I gave him a rough explanation and took a weird picture. Anyway, if you\\'re going to do a room escape, go somewhere else. It\\'s comfortable and nice. I\\'m so happy that there\\'s a place like this in the digital zone.. The advantage is that the only room cafe in Yeongdeungpo has a bad taste and a price that doesn\\'t match it. The coffee is too serious. It\\'s cheaper and better than other room cafes, but it\\'s a flaw if it\\'s not in the room format but in the open ceremony. Still, as if you come to cheap food often, there are no customers and it is the only room cafe in Yeongdeungpo and it is exclusive. Students, come here right now. The only room cafe in Yeongdeungpo! It\\'s located in a corner, so you can\\'t see it from the outside, but it\\'s quite crowded.Neung~. I strongly recommend this. Precious memories in a cozy atmosphere. You can feel it.^^*. nan. nan. nan. Zoljaemu. Due to Corona, it will be open from April 6th. Table tennis court. It\\'s the best. Good. Table tennis court. Rock bowling is the best. The air conditioner is full, the lounge is good, and the facilities are the best. Rock bowling was really fun. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh When I said I had to wait, I felt more nervous and wanted to hit it.I\\'m a little upset because I got bitten by Gambi, but  I\\'m sorry to spill the drink, but thank you for being kind. I\\'ll go again next time. It\\'s been a long time since I had fun. I think it\\'s the best bowling alley I\\'ve ever been to. If you use the event plan well, you can play at a lower price than half the price. Play billiards, table tennis, bowling, and have a good day! I\\'m totally satisfied. I hope you prosper! I tried it yesterday because it was Rock Bowling Day and it was so much fun!!! There\\'s a lot of light balls for women to hit, clean facilities, and I\\'m going to go every Monday.I want to play until dawn on weekends, but I\\'m a little sad that it\\'s a weekday, but thank you so much for having such a place in Konkuk University.~~~~~~~ The disadvantage of having such a good facility is that you have to wait on weekends.^^ The bowling wait is small and play billiards and table tennis.The billiard room is great too. The facilities are so nice and especially rock bowling is so fun. I don\\'t know if the ball is fluorescent because of rock bowling, but the ball is pretty and it\\'s for rent, but I think it\\'s very clean. Shoes are clean and free socks are also available to people who come barefoot. an unexpectedly good facility in a shabby neighborhood I\\'m satisfied.. Some of them were untangled in the middle, and the explanation was a little weird. One of the part-timers was kind, but the person who explained it to us was very unfriendly. It\\'s not good. The quality is so bad. I\\'d rather go somewhere else. I haven\\'t been immersed since the beginning. I didn\\'t start with an eye patch on, and I didn\\'t explain it well, so I had a hard time without basic supplies. People are kind!!. The kids came to Dallas and they didn\\'t come out of the room, and they had a lot of fun with each other, so I took a good rest in a long time ago. I like it because it\\'s big and there are many comfortable places to stay! But the sound of the song was loud, so I was sad. And please make the ramen too spread out. Hahahaha... The woman with long hair who works at 11 p.m. on Friday night, she\\'s so unfriendly.LOL. Why do you look so bad all the time at work and throw it at me when you\\'re giving a drink? If you don\\'t want to work, please don\\'t. Why should the customers who went to the comic books feel bad? It is the only place that I have been to that is open 24 hours a day and has a lot of seats on the 3rd and 4th floors. I love the food.. If it was okay, part-timer, no disrespect.. I\\'ve been to a lot of other comic cafe chains, but I really didn\\'t like being stuck in a small space. There\\'s plenty of space here, lots of books, and the sofa bed is the most comfortable. I\\'ve been sleeping It\\'s not set at all.I was wondering where they went because there were no 123 books, but they were packed in another bookcase, and there were other books that should be in the webtoon box, but there were many books that were not organized, so I couldn\\'t see them.. I don\\'t like it. I recorded it and e-mailed it, but it didn\\'t come... You\\'ve been tricked. It doesn\\'t seem to have any transmission function at all. The facility is bad, but four songs cost 1,000 won. There are three nearby, and this is the worst facility. Late years come first while waiting. Tell Alba to come out. I didn\\'t even put the money in, but I didn\\'t know you were here first. Don\\'t you know how to ask if you don\\'t know the order?. 3,000 won, one hour. Do you need another word? It\\'s the best.. It\\'s really pretty here when the cherry blossoms bloom. Long time no see. Asia Park... A park that often takes a walk at home because it\\'s a limited subway home. It\\'s small but has a lot of grass and trees are big and dense. Especially the pictures taken with yellow ginkgo trees and nice streetlights in the fall are British.. It\\'s not delicious and In Seong says everything. The atmosphere was nice and the cookies you gave me were very delicious! I will visit often! You\\'re crazy, you\\'re talking down to me for the first time -- no matter what you do with that personality.. He\\'s so nice, he\\'s got a lot of cartoons, he\\'s got a big place, he\\'s awesome.. The facilities are clean and nice! The staff was kind and nice. I went to play with my friend. The facilities are nice and the staff is kind! It was nice to have a nice staff. I\\'m going to visit again next time. It wasn\\'t boring because I could play pool while waiting. Three of us played two games and it came out to be 10,000 won. I want to go here again, so I like Yeongdeungpo. I\\'m going to go at night next time! The music selection is my style... The atmosphere is nice~ The waiting room is more comfortable, so it\\'s even better! Good. I like the place where I enjoyed bowling! It\\'s the best. Good. It\\'s the best. Dangsan\\'s glow-in-the-dark bowling alley.. Staff members are so kind. They explain the theme well, take good pictures, and pay close attention to the board\\'s. Thank you so much for lending me an umbrella since it suddenly rained.. Good. The air is stuffy due to poor ventilation and cleaning, the microphone speaker is not in good condition, and the lighting is 1,000 won for 3 songs. three thousand won songs. The boss is kind and clean inside!. I\\'ve been there a while ago, but the location is a bit ambiguous, but the meals are so good and good. There weren\\'t that many customers, but they didn\\'t disappear. She\\'s a regular! She\\'s clean, quiet, she\\'s looking for books. Stir-fried rice is really delicious... When I read a book after eating, I get sleepy and sleep for a couple of hours.It\\'s really comfortable. I recommend it. I came here because I heard it was new, and the facilities were nice and clean. I think I\\'ll come here often. You can watch TV!. The staff was kind, but the theme of Hell\\'s Delivery Service itself was not good. The device was unkind and the story was crude.. It\\'s normal.. I\\'ve always felt like a boring date, but it\\'s fresh and amazing. I had so much fun.GFRIEND likes it betterI will come often! The counters are very kind, and the most well-organized and well-organized in Daehangno Room Escape. Why are you so annoying when you come in at the end? That\\'s too much! He\\'s not coming again! It was the first time I went to an escape room cafe and it was fun. Every time I went on the same date course, I had a lot of fun. Make sure to go. It\\'s going to be fun! First of all, I was glad that the people at the counter were so kind. I liked it because it was full of contents and the interior was pretty. I went with my boyfriend and it\\'s so much fun. I strongly recommend it! That\\'s thrilling!! I had fun with my friends. I had a lot of fun.I went to play with my boyfriend and it was so much fun!! I\\'ll go to the other room again!. The bowling alley is so clean~~~~ The coffee near the snack corner is so delicious.*^^*~. It\\'s really neat and has an event price, so it\\'s really cheap. (I don\\'t know how long the event will last.) Coffee tastes good, beer, ramen and snacks. It\\'s well-maintained and good! However, the parking lot is a parking lot that goes down by Elbe, but it\\'s an old building, so big cars can\\'t be used by Elbe. There are two parking lots, but other parking lots were hard to park because there were so many cars... It is a new bowling alley, so it is totally good.*^^*~Rain is really good, too*^^*~. I\\'ve been to a lot of other comic cafe chains, but I really didn\\'t like being stuck in a small space. There\\'s plenty of space here, lots of books, and the sofa bed is the most comfortable. I\\'ve been sleeping It\\'s not set at all.I was wondering where they went because there were no 123 books, but they were packed in another bookcase, and there were other books that should be in the webtoon box, but there were many books that were not organized, so I couldn\\'t see them.. Wide, clean environment. Sound quality is the best.I loved it. The room is spacious and clean, and the facilities are so good that the sound is perfect. It\\'s the best.. The staff are so kind and it\\'s like a family. Various programs for young people, including the most delicious coffee I\\'ve ever had. I strongly recommend... Welcome. The coffee is delicious. It\\'s convenient to do personal work because it\\'s spacious.. The best part is very kind!!! Rose risotto is recommended. No book. Not good. It\\'s okay... haha chocolate banana. The facilities are good and everything is good, but my eyes hurt because of the dim lighting in the book reading area and the sound of the song is so loud that it bothers me when I read the book. If you drink only and don\\'t eat anything, it\\'s not that wide. Books aren\\'t diverse.. I\\'ve finally tried it! Delicious! Pizza! It\\'s fun to watch. Expensive and plain taste. Corn pizza in Mecenapolis! The taste is so so~ The people who work were very kind. Healthy pizza with unique shape and low calories ^^. Okay, it\\'s normal.. It\\'s the best. The facilities are good, the price is good, the part-time job is good, but I don\\'t know why you wrote it like that.. It\\'s not crowded, it\\'s clean, it\\'s quiet, it\\'s quiet, it\\'s like a nice park to take a rest.    I was surprised to hear that there was such a place in Seoul Hongeun-dong in Baekryunsan Park, and I envied the residents living here. I don\\'t like it. Last fall, I rode a local bus to find my heels~ When I enter the park, there is a small garden next to the bathroom that feels like there. I like it because it is filled with big, pretty trees that stretch out even though the space is not that big.  The park is small, so it\\'s pretty. I went around Mt. Baekryeon once, and it was nice.  I will visit you again as a fan even if it\\'s far away. *^^*. This forest was created by the DC Inside Sung Si Kyung Gallery to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Sung Si Kyung\\'s debut. This forest was made to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Sung Si-kyung\\'s debut by DC inside SSK Gallery. Jal ja la yo :). Purun, raspberry, cranberry, etc. All of my favorite menus are fruit juice and takeout cheap! You\\'re kind, too! Nice to play with plenty of board games.. I don\\'t like the lane. I don\\'t like the overall facilities. But the price is 4,200 won per game and 4,900 won for dinner and weekend, but the shoe rental fee is also charged separately. I regret paying 3,500 won for other places. an unparalleled facility Lane\\'s a mess, and the balls are either balls or stones. 8 lanes in total. It\\'s normal. --Kk. That\\'s too much for the obstruction report.. A place where the bathroom stinks really bad and the smell of feces is strong, and the counterbo staff is unkind and never goes twice. I don\\'t like it. The facilities are not good, and the cartoons are all about adult cartoons. It\\'s cold. Cigarette smell. Oh, I can\\'t get out of here because I paid in advance. When I looked up all the reviews, I said it doesn\\'t smell like cigarettes, but it made me snore and I ended up losing money.. It is not managed well because it is unmanned. Non-members are discriminated against, only receiving cash on the theme of kiosk, and even if the song is not played after inputting the song. It\\'s normal. It was a nice karaoke that I used to go to quite often. There was a problem one day, so I asked the staff to solve it. I thought a gangster was picking on you while playing a game with a boss pointed at a customer while playing a game. I could have asked you in a polite way, but I was dumbfounded by your attitude. It may have been easy for me to look young, but I\\'ve never seen a merchant take such a attitude toward a customer.Folding. It\\'s the best.. nan. I like the theme here. The facilities are cleaner than other places. The facilities were nice because they were clean and the staff was kind. I used a short sleep theme, and the story and components were all good. It\\'s kind of you. Recommend a short sleep theme. The theme was good, but the staff wasn\\'t good. He was a male and female employee, but he couldn\\'t explain anything properly and was sloppy. I didn\\'t give you any hints quickly, but the staff blamed me for the time. Each theme is a great place for Sherlock. Personally, I think that Sinchon branch and this place are the two major mountains.. Latest equipment! Good. Unkind. I don\\'t care if people come or not. I just touch my phone. The current time is Saturday 12:37 before the opening. That\\'s too bad. You said you\\'d open at 10, but you don\\'t think a lot of people would come.. It\\'s the best.. under construction. There are a lot of comic books and it\\'s okay, but the smell of cigarettes is so bad that only 3 people can use the game machine. How kind of a staff!  (based on September 26, 2019) The facility is very clean. I hope the cushions, dolls, etc. are always kept clean.I thought there were so many menu items that can be ordered among the comic cafe chains. There are not many kinds of comic books, but they are all covered and in good condition! It\\'s the best. Smells bad. The staff is kind.. There were a lot of amazing equipment and it was fun. The staff are very kind. ^^. I like everything, but I don\\'t have many books, I don\\'t have the latest books, and I like it because there are many seats, but I really don\\'t have many books. It\\'s the best. All the employees look like they don\\'t want to work and the room is a little small, so it\\'s uncomfortable.I prefer the Hongdae Nolreuk Forest. You changed your part-time job.The lady wearing glasses is so very kind!Facilities are the best. You need to train your employees. I was especially offended by the fact that the female staff seemed to be annoyed. I don\\'t want to go again... an unkind male worker If you speak to yourself like you\\'re muttering and ask again, your face will be stiff. I came here because of the good reviews, but I won\\'t come back again. The price is good and a good place to come with your girlfriend. Nice facilities and new comic books! Good. Walk and come when you have a hard time. It\\'s the best. There\\'s a lot to do and it\\'s good to rest. I\\'m sitting in a cave room, so I can lie down and give you a piggyback ride.It\\'s a true healer.Even the food is delicious.~Taking the time off!. The facilities were not good, but I was in good condition, so I reached the peak. The seats are smaller than I thought. The bowling ball is simple. Hehe. It\\'s the worst. The service and the facilities. I don\\'t know about ordinary people, but bowling players don\\'t have a lot of rainwater, oil maintenance, and elevators. It\\'s not wide, but it\\'s okay to play with friends. Student ID is a must!. The mike smells like mop too much... I didn\\'t want to cover it up, but I caught a cold after I got back from it. A germ-bottomed microphone.. nan. nan. I think it\\'s a good place to walk. Especially, it\\'s nice to have a tower at the top. It\\'s the best. Let\\'s go around the neighborhood together!. It\\'s normal.. nan. You are so unkind that I will never go back... I\\'ve never been to such a thoughtless cafe. It\\'s a loud song, and you\\'re keeping an eye on it.It was uncomfortable. It\\'s the best. It\\'s delicious. Desserts, drinks, sweet, savory, and rich! It feels like I made everything myself. I\\'ve been going there for days in a row, but I think I\\'ll go again. It was hard to find because the entrance was so hidden, but I really like the cute and cozy feeling when I come in! Fruit paplava was so delicious!!Fresh cream and fruit on meringue pie. It was sweet and delicious.I like the cost-effectiveness and the cute details that make you feel like you have a crush on the cafe. It\\'s an atmosphere women would like.. The atmosphere was so hip, the store was beautiful, and the staff was so kind that I went too far. lol. It\\'s the interior, lighting, and the atmosphere is bound to be exciting. The song selection is good, so I\\'m so excited the whole time. It looked small on the outside, but when I went inside, it was so big that I was surprised.  The atmosphere is good. I went to Itaewon with my friends for the first time in a long time. I went to see the review and the rain was so nice.The staff service was good too. Especially, the signature menu, Smashing Beer, was good. There is no oil. Emotional theme no.1. It is cute and has some things to see and put the drink in the tumbler.  But the bathroom is dirty!!! It\\'s not that dirty, but people who are sensitive to cleanliness are shocked.. Four thousand won (five thousand won) Time limit 1 minute sound room has both jagged wings (good places and bad places) and Geumyeong. I recommend you to go to coin karaoke rooms near Sinchon instead of waiting on weekends evening. I didn\\'t like it. Please don\\'t go.   If you don\\'t sing within a minute of the time limit, it turns into a song I don\\'t know, and it\\'s not even a soundproof.    It\\'s so dirty.. I don\\'t like it.. One point is enough. It\\'s too loud, it\\'s not greasy, it\\'s short, it\\'s narrow, don\\'t go. Hangame 7000 is too expensive... Are you a foreigner? He speaks poorly, has a vague pronunciation, and has a terrible calculation. The facilities are neat and the staff is kind.^^. The boss is so kind and the price is cheaper than around him. He\\'s so kind. The room is so neat. There are so many kinds of books and I\\'m searching for what I want to see, so they helped me find them. It\\'s 4,500 won for tteokbokki, and the amount is not good and the taste is not good. When I heard the cushion in my room, it\\'s hard to organize what others use, even if there are things inside, don\\'t come back. It smells........ It\\'s not cheap, but it\\'s comfortable and good.. a preliminary exercise at a sports event. There are a lot of themes and I\\'m really into it, so when I come to Daehakro, I\\'ll definitely have to come back here.I went to the escape room with my friends and the story is interesting here.I had a comedy with my friends.I think I go here once a month with my girlfriend. I like this place because it has the cleanest facilities and a lot of food! The story is also interesting, so I\\'m getting immersed. I\\'m going to try a different version next time. It was my first time to go to an escape room. I used a weekend discount and it was so much fun that I think I would go there often. Haha. All right. nan. It\\'s hard to find an old comic book like this in Eunpyeong-gu. There are a lot of books and you have good manners. I highly recommend you. ^^. nan. This place where I spent a happy time with my people! It\\'s pleasant and books are diverse.. I strongly recommend this. Precious memories in a cozy atmosphere. You can feel it.^^*. Every time I go, the woman explains it, and it\\'s so good. They explain well and respond well. Escape rooms are not forced and have good quality. Give me a bracelet when you escape! .It\\'s normal. Okay.. nan. Good. It\\'s the best. I didn\\'t escape today, but it\\'s the best! I\\'m not sure about the error, but the staff were kind and nice.It would have been better if I escaped, but I am satisfied with it because you let me solve it until the end. There\\'s a lot of device error. The staff members were kind. The god of weather is so much fun.. nan. Mike has no echo. 500 won per song.. Where the rails and the atmosphere are all set, we have to go to the invincible zone. It\\'s a nice Excited! Kind. The atmosphere is so good!!. It\\'s much nicer than the one next door, and the owner is kind and there are many kinds of games, it\\'s very clean and clean, and the coffee and drink are delicious. Much better than the next store. When I first opened it, I went there a few times, and the machine itself was a middle and high school student, and the owner didn\\'t have much knowledge of the machine, so I remember that when there was a problem, the handling was very poor... I don\\'t even have a pro shop, but I wonder what\\'s going on now. Friendly stuff. Good account, never had a failed pin or stuck ball.. a certificate of good bowling alley You\\'re barely able to kick me out because I\\'m on standby.  I\\'ve never seen a bowling alley like this before. It\\'s fun like a club. It\\'s fun to play basketball, darts, and entertainment during waiting time. There are only 6 lines, so if there are a lot of people, waiting time is long.. As soon as I went in, I asked the number of people who were waiting for me. I saw them muttering in the back so that they could hear me. I just went in with my friends and made fun of them, and I got really upset. Despite the fact that there is no employee involved due to the nature of the coin karaoke, the employee\\'s discomfort has only increased. All four songs are the same for 1,000 won anyway, so I don\\'t think you need to go here even if you\\'re upset. I was very disappointed.Folding. When I went there in the evening, there were two part-timers, both female and male, and neither of them was cheap. I didn\\'t know why I had to pay for it. I felt bad from the beginning. If you want to enjoy the game, go somewhere else.. I like it because it\\'s quiet.. Gangseo-gu\\'s best bowling alley!!! The facilities are good, the staff is kind, and above all, the shop is excellent. The workshop is perfect.. It\\'s clean, kind, and has many kinds.. I have been to a lot of comic cafes here and the chairs are comfortable here! It\\'s not big, but it\\'s much more comfortable than this cave room. And comfortable because I didn\\'t take off my shoes.. Good~! You\\'ll find out when you get there! It\\'s the best.. It was very quiet and nice on weekdays. But I don\\'t have any books. This is the smallest forest I\\'ve ever been to visit. Please keep the opening hours. Don\\'t make it a waste of time. If you go bowling on the first basement floor of Nol Forest in front of Sungdae and go to Olive Young on the first floor and eat malatang on the second floor and go to Nolreuk Forest, you\\'ll be super honey.. There\\'s no answer for the elderly swimming pool-aged ladies here. There\\'s no way to improve at all. There\\'s no swimming pool manners, there\\'s no level difference, there\\'s no lane occupation, and you have to take a cold shower if you go into the men\\'s bath in winter. Even if you say it\\'s that watery, there\\'s no room for improvement. The bowling alley counter is really rude. The bowling alley is open-minded and only those who can laugh even if the boss curses you.On the phone, they told me to wait 20 minutes, so I went far, and they told me to wait for an hour, and when I asked how long I had left, I got angry and asked why I didn\\'t get on the waiting list. I came out because I was scared. What\\'s funnier is his boss... It\\'s not very kind, but isn\\'t it basic to be good at teaching? (Bowling price information) 3600 per game for the general public. The entire gym has been replaced. The gym trainer is so nice. It seems to be a more luxurious facility than low-cost facilities such as the Gu Community Sports Center and Youth Training Center.  싼^ 싼 It is cheaper to find cheap places. Which neighborhood do you live in? ^사실 In fact, that\\'s not a bad facility for Gangnam ^ The owner of the building changed a lot, so the pool changed completely, the water was too clean, the sauna was nice, the swimming pool of the local elementary school, and the sauna was the level of the local bathhouse in the 1980s.It\\'s messy and...-,- The dressing room is also a messy gym. Open up the poor. The sauna facilities are the best.. It\\'s the best.. nan. I don\\'t like it because the bathroom is too small to sit down and the gap between the tables playing board games is narrow. The store is luxurious and nice.. There are many kinds of board games, and there are friends who play board games as if they are at a Korean restaurant. Part-timers are also very good at board games and have all the Mensa Recommendation Games series. It\\'s cheap, but you don\\'t know how much time passes, so you spend all your money.. It\\'s nice to be quiet. If no one knew. Is it ruined? a foot in the door. I hesitated a little bit, but I\\'m glad I got in. When I drink a glass of beer, I want to turn it into a replay of the coolness.  Actually, I recommend this place. I\\'m going to come back with my friend later.~~~~~ Happy Saturday~ I\\'ve got sesame from the beer. The table chair is dirty, so make sure to check it and sit down.~~ And I guess you\\'re not throwing away the bubbles you took out of your beer, you\\'re using them again. I didn\\'t know. It\\'s a state-of-the-art ordering system. Beer was ice-cold, and it was full of cool beer, boneless chicken, cheddar cheese fries, gorgonzola pizza, and fire squid.. nan. All right. It\\'s quiet and the best!!!   There aren\\'t many people~ It\\'s quiet and good to take a walk.  The night view of Banghwa Bridge is wonderful. hehehe. It\\'s the best board game cafe near Hankuk University of Foreign Studies! There are many board games and the atmosphere is good. Star in my heart... I don\\'t like it.. Cozy and friendly. It\\'s normal. It\\'s the best. I\\'ve been a regular for 3 years. I like roasting coffee. It\\'s fresh because it has a good rotation rate. I can\\'t go often, but I go whenever I think of coffee. It\\'s more delicious than an antler site, and some people get roasted beans here at other cafes nearby. Woonggon, fighting!!! Magpie Mountain Coffee Prince who sang with Fantastic Duo Kim Soohee!. I love reading books quietly.I like coffee, too. It\\'s quiet and small.  The boss is kind, too. I\\'m a little sad that I don\\'t have old comic books.. White theme. It\\'s great to bring outside snacks and eat them, and the boss kindly explains them.. 365 days, 24 hours, weight training facility. It\\'s free... it\\'s the best. It would be great if every local government in Korea has such facilities in the park. The pleasure of coming home late and working out. Kangdong-gu Cheonho Park is the best... Under the tree, under the cool wind, I\\'m relaxing my calves well.. I go there often because there is a playground and a few sports equipment. The playground is always crowded because there are many babies in the neighborhood.. Skip it when two people go. On the weekend, there were so many customers in the business that there were seven empty tables for four people, but I left them waiting for two people to be seated, and three of them were given seats.There aren\\'t many kinds of games, but there are plenty of seats. The interior is a bit desolate, but the bathroom is clean and there is no problem with the game. It\\'s a waste of a single star. Even if the bathroom is blocked, you don\\'t have to solve it, and you don\\'t have to find the game. They didn\\'t even understand the explanation, so I searched and looked it up myself. There is a reason not to go ᅮI hope you improve your service. Some games don\\'t have different kinds of games that can or can\\'t be explained and smell.. Please take the garbage you brought --. I like them all, but please show me where the delivery zone is on the map Please. It\\'s the best. It\\'s good to go for a walk with your lover when it\\'s warm. It\\'s even better if you go after sunset. It\\'s normal.. The water was really easy and nice, but there are so many things that fit with drinking water. So I\\'m really sad about that. It\\'s the best.. I used to go there often because it was cheap and time limitless, but as time went by, I became more and more unfriendly and irritated and screamed when asked to explain the game. Board game cafe never to go again. Don\\'t do that. It\\'s the best. Clean, there are many kinds of games, and the part-timers are so kind to teach me the game. I\\'m going to go Kindness, clean, game variety, cheap price. The owner is so kind. I really want to be a regular customer. The place where drip coffee is delicious and the owner is kind! If you become a regular customer, you become a hideout. I\\'ve been a regular for 14 years. It\\'s a drip coffee shop, but I also follow other menus.  Bingsu is annoying when a regular customer orders it. It\\'s a cozy place with a variety of board games, books, and comic books, so it\\'s good for a date.. I said I would drink a two-hour plan, but I paid separately when I paid. Get rid of the game console I\\'m getting on my nerves because of the knocking sound of the game console. It used to be good, but it\\'s getting really loud. Go somewhere else. There are many comic book cafes nearby, not here. It\\'s normal.. It\\'s better to go to the park at night behind the Geumcheon-gu Culture and Sports Center.. I love it!It was a whole new world as soon as I walked in!   The staff were so kind, and there were so many coffee and tea types that I loved! Oh! It\\'s so neat and nice! I went in and there was a lot of space, tea, and coffee is unlimited!!!!! I can smell it all over the store and I really like it:) I\\'m writing a report and chatting with my friend! It\\'s the best.. As if the lady is smiling and kind and gentle. I totally recommend it. I\\'ve been there about four times recently, and all the shops are kind and delicious!!  There weren\\'t many people so it was good to eat alone or go comfortably with friends. I don\\'t know if it\\'s because of the location, but there aren\\'t many customers. Hurry up and go!!. nan. It\\'s the best.. This is the paradise. What a wonderful place! You\\'re the best! You\\'re the best. There\\'s nothing to envy if you lie still on the mountain. :). I tried to find it, but it\\'s not there. We have comic, pure, webtoons, adults, one-day cartoons, fantasy, martial arts, and a large number of sections and new books. The business hours are from 9 am to 12 pm. 070 7555 8722. It\\'s the best.. I had some time left, so I went in for a while, but it was bigger than I thought, and I came out after a long time.~~. The side dishes of the cocktail restaurant are good, too. But the view is even better. The view is really pretty when you go around the sunset. I think I should pay more attention to the service than the blog advertisement.. sp.. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m playing my part in a comic book store.  I don\\'t have many books. The state of the book is not so good. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best.. It was nice to know the location of the comic book and it was comfortable. It\\'s normal.. What a fun new game. Feels like I\\'ve become a giant. A good place for your social development to get out of Hikikomori. . .A pleasant place to play! Come on, everybody.. It\\'s a good place to go when you want to see cats and cartoons! There are quite a lot of comic books, so I might be staying up all day. The downside is that cat hair is everywhere, so when you wear black clothes, cat masks are all embedded. The food is so delicious and kind and the amount of books I have is the best. I just want to go here. I\\'ve used it a few times, but it\\'s too unfriendly. I feel like I\\'m guilty of using it. I\\'ve used it because it\\'s near school, but I think I\\'m going to go somewhere far away and use a different branch. Cats. They don\\'t seem to say much when they tease them. Pity for the cat.  If there are many books and no children, it is quiet enough. Do you like the food here?. You\\'re the best. Son Kee-chung. A good place to take a quiet walk in the evening. a place where a suitable number of people take a walk.. It\\'s really nice because it\\'s clean. I can feel that you\\'re paying attention to the scent of the blanket and cleanliness. There are a lot of new books. There\\'s a lot of books. The owner is kind and the comic book cafe is comfortable, so it\\'s good to take a nap. I like that webtoons and cartoons are updated quickly. I often go with my girlfriend. The room is neat. The food is so good that it doesn\\'t come out well inside.The location is so good that there are too many people on weekends. ᅲ You have to wait a while to go to the bathroom. The latest one is in 2015.... I don\\'t like it. Never go. I went in, and there were pieces of tissue, hair, and even curly hair on the floor, presumed to be a conspiracy.... It\\'s very hygienic, and it\\'s illegal to watch movies and subtitles. I really hope you don\\'t go.. Yongtral Park is pretty. It\\'s in the middle of the city, but there\\'s a wide lawn and a lake-like pond, so I could see a few people holding a mat for a picnic. The park is even prettier in spring because there are many cherry trees.~~! The National Museum of Korea is right next to you, so make sure to visit the park when you come! Parking is not enough, so you can park it at the National Museum of Korea and take a walk. It used to be a golf course for the 8th U.S. Army, so the spacious lawn is impressive. It would be grateful to have such a park in Seoul, but the traffic is so inconvenient. The number of parking spaces is too small. . . . . . . .. Along with the number of comic book branches, the service is less than one point. I search on the map, but it doesn\\'t come out if I search on the comic cafe. There are a lot of things like that whether the policy has changed these days Anyway, I was looking at the map and going to another cartoon cafe and came in once. It\\'s spacious and nice. I think I\\'ll come back next time. Have a great time. Comfortable in front of the station.LOL. oppo b.. One song for 500 won or three minutes for 500 won. No guests. If you\\'re looking for a karaoke room where you can always go in, here. ⏺⏹⏏⏯◀⏪⏮⏫⏬⏸▶⏩⏭. It\\'s the best. The only park nearby. It\\'s a must-see for dogs. Lots of dog poop.. Just cash. Lots of guys, lots of comic books.. It smells like cigarettes, if not directly from the inside, and it\\'s for kids, and I think it\\'s a bit off-the-shelf, but compared to that, there\\'s a lot of chips and cash-related writing, so... it\\'s kind of... it doesn\\'t feel like a lot of board games. Of course, there was a Citadel Catan Splender.. I don\\'t know about hygiene and kindness, but the seats are unlimited and the seats are unlimited, so it\\'s not a big deal. Aren\\'t the male workers here too big? You point a finger at me. You\\'ve never worked before. I went to feel good with my friends on holiday, but I gave them my money and they were so unfriendly and I couldn\\'t play a game because I didn\\'t have anything to do. Be thankful that it ended like that. The male employee was very unfriendly, sitting on cushions, dirty, uncomfortable, and I felt very bad all day because of him. I\\'m really not going again. The service is zero. The cushions and cushions are so unsanitary and the staff is so unkind that I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go again. There are not many kinds of movies. I have to pay for all the movies, and I don\\'t know if it\\'s a male ring owner or not. I\\'ll never go again. I feel so dirty. I\\'ll talk informally. I\\'ve eaten.. It smells so bad, the location of the bathroom is so bad, and above all, the hygiene is so... Too many drunk, too many kickers on the wall and spit out a lot... ..clean and well-equipped. Good facilities.. a good place to run It\\'s nice to have no people even though there\\'s nothing. a dancing fountain My mind also cools down. He plays with water and I sit back and look at the world.. Wow, this is perfect! The boss is kind and he explains it very well. I\\'ve been to other places, too.I\\'m gonna have to come over here.~~~~ I ordered coffee, and I hope you enjoy the aroma~~ I\\'ll come back next time to get some healing.Is it because it\\'s an unusual dating course? My girlfriend likes it. I was so cold that I was shaking and loosened up my muscles.  A cup of coffee after a break. It was a bit disappointing that there was no Jota elevator. It was a satisfying dating course. Active recommendation. It was a series of boring dates every weekend after watching movies and eating. It was different. I went there because my boyfriend wanted to When I think of massage chairs, I thought of old people only, but it was a new world to have a place like this with a cool body.  I am surprised that the staff is kind and the coffee I drink is delicious. Usually, cafes with this kind of package taste like coffee, but it\\'s delicious. It was neat and the atmosphere was cute and pretty.  I\\'ve been to other Mr. Healing too, but the Ewha store was cleaner and the boss was kind. I got Pepero Day as a gift. I think it would be good to go on a date, but I think it would be good to have a good time with my parents. Kind and nice.. The pride of Seoul. It\\'s the best. A good place to see dogs. Yeontral Park. I like Yeontral Park because it is a bit noisy and the book is quiet.. It\\'s a self-wrote review. This is the history. The owner is so kind. The person who loves board games. The only place in the country that lives here is Gyeonggi Province. But I still use public transportation to play board games. Now I\\'ll collect coupons and drink free next time. That\\'s the best. Mr. President is so kind and pleasant.Of all the board cafes I\\'ve been to, I enjoyed myself the most. I\\'m going to go often Haha. There are a lot of games and the staff are very kind. This is the best place I\\'ve ever been to. Neat, diverse game numbers, and all the part-timers are kind. He\\'s moved here to exit 4 in Sinnonhyeon.~^^^. This is the cleanest part. My beloved store! The board game is the best! This is Oz♥. Board game cafe!. I didn\\'t know he was here, so I went to check out the water, and he was walking away. Okay, that\\'s good enough, but I\\'m getting paid. Are you kidding me? I came to sing and got cursed at. I\\'m so upset that I don\\'t come. I\\'ve been here two or three times a week, so I\\'ll skip tattoo parvaya. It\\'s normal.. It\\'s normal. 20140517, Saturday Eye Shopping. Food court is really not good. I\\'d rather eat at the store. Food court and other auxiliary facilities are really bad if the price is a little lower. Light.. I think it\\'s good to drink infinity beer and do a board cafe. I like it because I can have fun with my friends cheaply. It\\'s a neat, beer killer, perfect for me. Unlimited Nice~~ I went out to have dinner with my friends. The staff were so kind and we had a lot of fun drinking infinity beer.I strongly recommend it when I play with my friends. Have a nice and clean time. LOL. Infinite beer is awesome.. The atmosphere was so nice and the panini was really delicious!. Okay.. Oh! If you get 100 points, you get a service and it\\'s pleasant and nice:. I strongly recommend this. Precious memories in a cozy atmosphere. You can feel it.^^*. I don\\'t like it. Good. It\\'s the best. Seoul Mayor Lee Myung-bak\\'s night scenery are amazing achievement!^^. Love\\'s Coinfield Event. By the way, why do I want these coins? It\\'s good because there are many events and Sora Tower in Cheonggye Plaza 3 minutes away from Jonggak Station.  Walking Cheonggye Stream is also very good.  There are a lot of good restaurants, restaurants, bars, etc. nearby, so it\\'s a date attraction.I envy you so much for going to Ansan.. I\\'ve never been there before, but the sound is good. I\\'m the best on my own.. I hope you clean up the most secluded and quiet forest I\\'ve ever been to. I hope you will continue to do I\\'m sorry, but do you call this food? I can\\'t match the amount of water I drink. It tastes like chocolate banana water. Dinner\\'s salty, stinky, and it\\'s such a waste of money. Do you hire any part-timers? I just wanted to end it by telling him not to come back, but that\\'s so mean. I don\\'t really have any comic books. I don\\'t even know how to organize books that are cheap at secondhand bookstores. It\\'s not just the books, it\\'s the places where people sit. I asked for a clean-up, and I came with a frown on my face, so I just gave you a blanket. I think I used to drink alcohol at least in other forests and push my hair with a twirl. Okay, comic books are really small, with my brother.. It was good because it had unlimited time, drinks, and fried rice with 10,000 won on weekdays from 11 to Everything\\'s good except for the kids talking! It\\'s so comfortable and nice! It\\'s cheap and it\\'s an extra hour for the event period.. It\\'s a nice little park and the play ground is the Wizard of Oz the only thing I don\\'t like about it is that it\\'s perfect and there\\'s no grass.. 젛 Many menus are not closed; it\\'s in A-dong, so check carefully, it\\'s closed.. It\\'s the best. Seoripul Park\\'s hiking trail. It\\'s the best. It\\'s so good to exercise, take a walk ^^^ Rabbit running around a lot. A promenade. A silkworm. Montmartre Park across the Nuadari. It\\'s neat and has a good sound quality. Best. Many places cost 1,000 won for 4 songs, but here are 3 songs. Why?. A good place to take a walk and exercise. a bright atmosphere a test drive for a spoiler @Paris Park. Probably a place for the soul, not a house. There\\'s a park pond for a walk. It is a park with beautiful four seasons.. It\\'s the best.. The drinks here are really good, and board games are all new. The best board game cafe I\\'ve ever been to!!!!!! Among them, it\\'s fun to play with Lost City\\'s boyfriend. It\\'s like a new board game cafe, and the atmosphere was nice and the coffee was delicious.. I went because I wanted to play various games, but there are few kinds, and I don\\'t know what to recommend, and I didn\\'t explain it properly, so I don\\'t recommend it to anyone who wants to play a board game. The smell of cigarettes is bad, too. The owner is kind and there are many kinds of board games and drinks, so I think it\\'s a place where we can have fun! It\\'s like a room, so it was good to chat and play games comfortably. There were many kinds of board games and it was good to be comfortable. There are many kinds of food, so I\\'m not bored and I was surprised that the drinks were especially large and delicious. I think I will go there often in the future because the fare is cheap and it\\'s good to play with my friends! It was close to Seonneung Station and there were quite a lot of board games, so I had a lot of fun.I think it was good because the drinks were a bit of a quality taste that was sold at regular cafes. It was nice to play with each other because it was a room.If I have an appointment at Seonneung Station, I will visit again.Hehe. The boss is kind, but if you don\\'t like the smell of cigarettes, it\\'s quite nice.. nan. I don\\'t like it. The atmosphere is clean, quiet and comfortable. It is cold here in winter and hot in summer. If it\\'s too cold, turn on the heating machine. It\\'s very dry in winter. Even if you suggest it\\'s dry... Nothing\\'s changed. And after 11 o\\'clock, it\\'s unmanned, but maybe because it\\'s just one fingerprint, it\\'s very noisy because I brought my friends from middle and high school... I can\\'t concentrate at dawn. I\\'m actually worried about security. I\\'m scared because there\\'s a bathroom outside.. Café is so cute and cute. Meringue ice chocolate is also delicious. Cats-related menus are so cute and delicious. I\\'m sad that the chairs in the cafe are uncomfortable. I came to drink coffee and watched the cat goods for a long time. A small museum for cat lovers! Healing with friends! It\\'s a place with a lot of cat goods! If you like cats or animals, you can come and look around! I\\'m so happy that the boss is kind. The boss is kind and the coffee is so good. Grapefruit ade was the best thing I\\'ve ever had because it was handmade.  I\\'m happy to have so many pretty cat items. I\\'ll go often because it\\'s near my house!!!. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best.. The boss was so kind and the staff kindly informed me, so I went there without knowing anything, but I made it pretty! The price was cheaper than other stores and the ring design was pretty and diverse, so it was hard to choose! A/S is always available, so make a pretty couple ring here.. When we visited, the boss explained it so irritably that I was scared. It\\'s the best. It\\'s cheap. Please explain it well. Good, good. It\\'s clean inside! It\\'s a one-person drink, but the price was cheap, so it was good to drink without any burden. The game is well organized and the boss explains it well. The boss is kind and clean. game fun. Pokemon Go Pokestop I fear a lot.all. It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal.. First of all, I\\'m happy that the staff is so kind and I\\'m happy that the coffee beans are roasting themselves because the scent was spread out inside the cafe. There\\'s a separate bathroom, so I don\\'t have to go outside. It\\'s nice. And it\\'s really nice because it\\' The music was good, and most of all, the coffee is really good. If you use hand drip coffee, you can choose your own beans and refill them for free. I was so satisfied. It was quiet. The store was smaller than I thought, but it\\'s too early to drink coffee. It\\'s the best. It\\'s self-boiled sweet red bean porridge!. I think I can study and enjoy my own time. But sometimes I get annoyed because I play popular music too loud. It would be nice to just play classical music or piano music, but it doesn\\'t suit the quiet and comfortable atmosphere, right? Except for that, it\\'s good to study, and it\\'s a good place to talk with friends. It\\'s close to Exit 4 of Gongneung Station.  To drink coffee.There are board games and cafes.It\\'s pretty and very crowded.It\\'s not. It was nice to talk about it.Coffee shot.Addable. 1500 won. Two shots if you addYou can add it. It\\'s the best. the most expensive and high-priced one. Dankke is fine, but iceblendid is expensive and small in quantity. Maybe it\\'s because it\\'s in front of the station. The coffee here is not good. No Matim. It\\'s a private store, but it\\'s not cheap. It\\'s the same as Tom Tam or franchise. Then why are you here?. I usually thought of it as a board game cafe with my girlfriend, so I looked around and looked it up, but it turned out to be an offline store that deals with minor board games such as miniature games and trpg. I liked games, so I knew a lot of information, but it was my first time seeing it in person. It seems like a good place to make it easy for players to get together with this kind of game, but there are often tables that make your eyes frown because it\\'s a game. Maybe because I visited on the weekend, it\\'s very noisy. We have a general board game, but it is difficult to explain, and we also sell a lot of game products. Folding. There is no menu such as fried rice. (appears to have disappeared since 2013). I went because everyone liked it, but I\\'m so disappointed. Nothing special but fried tteokbokki. The fries are totally soggy.Movies keep popping up, but that\\'s the original file. There is no piece in board games one by one. Don\\'t you check this? It\\'s neat and I\\'ll eat it. Too much. Good! I strongly recommend~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. I love you so much.~~~~~~~~~~. I like it because there are so many delicious foods. I was so satisfied with not only the snacks but also the actual food that makes me eat.. nan. The facilities aren\\'t very good. It\\'s the best. It\\'s not Seodaemun Station, it\\'s a park next to Independence Gate Station. Good. It\\'s the best.. 1. There are many kinds 2. Please explain well 3. The best conditions for board games because they are cheap. But it smells like cigarettes and the table is open, so it\\'s too loud. Especially with that toy hammer. I like it, but when you explain the game, your breath is so bad. I like it! It\\'s just a little old. You\\'re the best. Son Kee-chung. A good place to take a quiet walk in the evening. a place where a suitable number of people take a walk.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Great. The people who work are kind and explain the game well.^^ The price is reasonable. You played games with your boyfriend in a good mood! I strongly recommend it.. It\\'s cheap, clean, and nice. I always go here.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s not big, but I like it because it\\'s unexpectedly clean and there are a lot of books. It\\'s the best. It\\'s nice and neat and has a lot of comic books. The boss is kind and I like it because he cleans up every time the customer leaves. You\\'re kind and nice.. The facilities are so neat, keep the service down, boss?I\\'ve seen you take care of young women, and I think you\\'ll get a lot of benefits if you\\'re a regular... The staff are so kind that I\\'m having a great time!! Thank you for your pleasant greetings and keep your business going!(Good luck singing one service song!) The facilities and prices are all good except for the late opening. The facilities you always go to are clean. Boss? The staff is saying it in a very unpleasant way. There are a lot of coin karaoke rooms around here.. It\\'s the best.. All the staff are very kind and very detailed. I had a great time with my friends after a long time.I\\'ve been here for 5 hours.LOL The part-timers are playing games. Okay.. It\\'s salted fish. I misread it as salted fish park.Hahaha. Unlike the exterior of the building, it\\'s neat and nice. The boss is very kind. He\\'s the best. Clean and kind, worth visiting. Room escape was fun and the boss was kind, so it was good. The room escape, where you search and solve the problem without context. People who have been to places that have been done well in stages may be dumbfounded. Employees are so unkind. When you call to give a hint, you give a lecture and talk in a silent tone. The store seems to be proud of the room design, but it\\'s just a self-satisfied design without considering the player. It\\'s better for your mental health to look around for other room escape than to The best. The most famous room escape cafe near Konkuk University and Children\\'s Grand Park. It\\'s a huge and fun place to date!♡. sp.. A small but beautiful park with everything. It\\'s well managed. It\\'s bigger than normal neighborhood park, but I wish there was a track or something I want to make a track across the street, like playing on the ground above or cutting down on the field. There are a lot of people in Boramae Park Grand Stadium. Do you think there will be no demand for the Nakseong Daedong Movement? Remove all the fields and expand the park. It\\'s a little disappointing. It\\'s good to go at night to sober up. Bicycle bouncing, bouncing, bouncing, bouncing.. The boss is kind and very clean. I\\'ll go again next time. The boss is kind and has a good voice. It\\'s clean and nice.. The pride of Seoul. It\\'s the best. A good place to see dogs. Yeontral Park. I like Yeontral Park because it is a bit noisy and the book is quiet.. More than I expected, if the coffee tastes good, I\\'m embarrassed.I think there are fewer books than anywhere else. It\\'s the worst. It\\'s so noisy, babies. It\\'s quiet, so I can concentrate well and clean. I can\\'t read books because of the kids, but I don\\'t want to go unless it\\'s family.. It\\'s clean and nice here, and there are lots of books... It is similar in size to other comic book cafes in Gangseo-gu, but the lack of cleanliness is.. At first, I thought it was only a short time since it opened. Same after nearly six months...There aren\\'t many books... I moved to Hwagok-dong and went to play. The comic book status is clean, and there is a sofa that I lie down on. The building seems to be old, but it\\'s clean since it\\'s been newly opened. I\\'ve been here a few times, and it\\'s the biggest and cleanest place I\\'ve ever been to.. nan. Sungnyemun Gate, National Treasure No. 1 Let\\'s get rid of the wounds and move on to the new millennium.. nan. I can have fun until the lower grade of elementary school. a fine view. It was good to go and play by bicycle. Free parking for Hyundai Card M3 Card 09:00 to 21:00 (November to March) 09:00 to 23:00 (April to October). First sunrise of 2014... Amazing. The road is a parking lot. Male employees at the MSD headquarters play a soccer game. Now, I\\'m not as strong as when I was in 6th grade in elementary school.Why am I here?. The biggest drawback is that I can\\'t control the microphone. The smell of the metal in the microphone is so different. It\\'s too much to see the coin door because it\\'s transparent. It\\'s so close to the waiting seats.. a good place to run It\\'s nice to have no people even though there\\'s nothing. a dancing fountain My mind also cools down. He plays with water and I sit back and look at the world.. It\\'s clean and a double-seat size. It\\'s spacious because you let me use it alone.I went to the counter in the morning of weekdays and there were two women, and they were so kind. You\\'re the best. You\\'re a blooper. - You\\'re unkind. I don\\'t want to come again. It\\'s the best.. Your mother and father are very kind.If you go early, it\\'s 1,000 won for 5 songs, so the cost-effectiveness is the best! If you get 100 points for 1,000 won for 5 songs as an event, you\\'ll get one more song. You\\'re the best. You were so kind. I liked the sound system of the wireless microwaves and the teasers.. I\\'m a little sad.. Boss, please stop by because we\\'re having a discount event.. Good. It\\'s the best. It was nice to go there during springtime! I hope the parking works better. Good, but it\\'s a mess. We... the lake and the shallow hill. It\\'s good to have a lot of benches. Personally, the Mondrian Garden is nice. The fountain that unfolds as the plane passes, and the night view that combines nice facilities and lighting. 2015.05 Shinwon Elementary School - Happy barley rice, good price, cheonggukjang + pork + barley rice.

I want to go. All right. The lake park fountain from the apartment. Where are all the pretty cocksuckers from? Good~~▶♣♣ I\\'m going to make it look good. Walking place. It\\'s nice, but is rusty season a concept? The flowers and trees change with the season. Beautiful place. Family, lovers, friends sometimes alone.

Especially, there are a lot of novels.~~The rental service seems to be good.... It was a place I used to go sometimes, but I stopped by in a long time ago and it was so nice to see so many romance comics that I didn\\'t have before.I\\'ll be a regular customer to the boss who always greets me with a smile even though I bother her to find me this and that whenever I go.~~. I love the taste of the drink and the atmosphere of the store, but I don\\'t give you happy points every time.I didn\\'t know I was getting points because you didn\\'t save me a few times.I got it from the receipt.. It\\'s been remodeled a while ago, and it\\'s very neat, but honestly, the rain is a rolling stock.However, I like the shop because it is very kind and has good workmanship.. On a weekend basis, 3,000 won per hour. Must drink x Order if needed. 1,000 won for bottled water. There are not many kinds of drinks. (Ryu Man sold at convenience stores..) They recommend well and there are many other games besides very famous ones. Good. I went because I wanted to play various games, but there are few kinds, and I don\\'t know what to recommend, and I didn\\'t explain it properly, so I don\\'t recommend it to anyone who wants to play a board game. The smell of cigarettes is bad, too. The owner is kind and there are many kinds of board games and drinks, so I think it\\'s a place where we can have fun!

The boss is kind, but if you don\\'t like the smell of cigarettes, it\\'s quite nice.. The facilities are good and the rain maintenance oil zone dry zone is good. I don\\'t know if it\\'s outsourced, but it doesn\\'t recover quickly even though several lanes are broken. It\\'s all good, but every time I go bowling, I don\\'t know if it\\'s a mechanical failure or something, and there\\'s a few missing bowling pins, and it happens every time... Good!!!

Bowling, billiards, and unfamiliar archery.~~~~~ I didn\\'t play well because of the appointment time, but I have to go again.~There are so many things I couldn\\'t do.I can\\'t believe there was a place like this in Times Square in Seoul! There are a lot of things to play such as bowling alley, archery, and pocket ball. I had a great time on a date because I didn\\'t have to go anywhere to enjoy it in one day.^^. The weather is hot outside these days, so I went shopping at Times Square and a new bowling alley opened. I like bowling so much and the facilities are clean, so I played it. The staff was nice, the facilities were very clean and nice. As expected, Seoul is good. ^^* I lost all my stress and had a lot of fun.  I think it\\'s a must at least once. I\\'ll have to go again. I had an appointment at Yeongdeungpo Station, and I stopped by Palm Square and went up to the bowling alley. It wasn\\'t the bowling alley that I thought of until now, but it was a place where I could enjoy various sports on a date, so I was surprised and I wanted to have this kind of facility in my neighborhood. I\\'d like to use it more often.^^. The bowling alley is clean and spacious, and I feel good because I\\'m good at playing games~~~~ There\\'s an archery field that I\\'ve only seen on TV, and it\\'s amazing and fun doing it for the first time. I\\'m so happy to have a bowling alley in Times Square.   I\\'m going to play games with my friends. Next time, I\\'m going to hit strikes twice in a row. It\\'s not easy.**. The bowling alley is really big and it\\'s a facility that\\'s tailored to the modern era. Also, billiard rooms are very neat. It\\'s so pleasant because it doesn\\'t smell like cigarettes. Archery was an event I\\'ve never experienced before, but it\\'s hard to experience it myself, but it\\'s so much fun and I want to continue. I love the part where I can enjoy sports because there are lots of drinks and things to eat. I\\'d love to come with my family. I went to see a movie and went up to a new bowling alley, and the facilities are wide and clean and nice.  There were a lot of people, so we had archery and billiard rooms together, so we could spend time doing other things. There were free pocket balls and board games, so I don\\'t think there was any inconvenience to use. I strongly recommend it as a dating course! I happened to go to Times Square and had a lot of fun. I went shopping, bowling, and archery. Archery is really good. I feel like a player. Everything about sports, all at once, but there\\'s such a wonderful place in the shopping center. This place is so convenient to use and you can wait to meet your friends. I highly recommend those who have enough time!!!

I will use it often from now on. I think it\\'s so nice to hang out with friends and lovers all!  At first, I thought the bowling alley was a little small, but there\\'s a big one inside. There\\'s an archery field, billiard room, darts, board games, and so many things to enjoy.^^ There were so many people so we had some waiting time, but the staff were so kind that we could comfortably wait.  I really recommend it!!! I strongly recommend it as a dating course! I stopped by once because the waiting time for the movie was long, and the atmosphere is crazy!!  Unlike the existing bowling alley, there are three sections, so each feels different.  Maybe because of the atmosphere, I also recorded the best record;; especially archery, which is difficult for beginners to encounter, was taught by the staff and experienced something different. The counter is pretty and all the staff are kind and I think it\\'s really nice.  I went there with my friends and it was really wide and clean. For your information, it was my first time playing archery and I didn\\'t know it was this fun. There was nothing else to do except shopping at Times Square.

The bosses are so kind that they can\\'t stop smiling around their mouths, and they have a lot of games and good explanations, so I\\'m going to go again next time. Woobong High School\\'s 3D Master Chief Executive, many board games + a wide table + a low price + a new customer\\'s challenge. nan. It\\'s really clean.I went to the bathroom especially with my girlfriend, but I didn\\'t know time was passing by.The president is kind and recommended.~~~~. It must be hard for you to have fewer customers these days, but I was happy that you were kind to me. I have too few comic books.There are no other facilities like the other Nol Foot massage, electric pad, charger, etc. It\\'s the best.. The staff are all kind. I feel good every time you go because you always treat me with a smile. Clean, warm, delicious food, and good for healing. It\\'s the best. It\\'s 2,400 won per hour. It\\'s also cheap to have a set of drinks.  Facilities are also clean and good.. Escape from a Room. nan. Well, the staff were very kind, so I had a good first impression, but I was going to teach you that cutting Doberman\\'s ears and poodle tail while talking to Ms. Shun is not a bad thing, and that\\'s what they did in England. (I don\\'t understand why you\\'re doing this all of a sudden.) And it\\'s good to take care of street cats, but it\\'s hard to communicate with them. I preached that cats born and raised on the street don\\'t like to take care of them too much. I and my friends were all dumbfounded in your philosophy. Folding. I\\'ve been to several cat cafes and it was the best. Looking at the gentle cats, the boss seems to care a lot. Thank you for the good time. Cats are so gentle, kind, and cute.~~^^. Quiet and cats are very gentle!! / staff / cats are very very keen to please the president well, I don\\'t mind if you go.  There are many children (infant, elementary school students). Please refer to it.. The facilities aren\\'t very good. I can\\'t help but feel a little offended by the unkind service, even if I try to understand that you\\'re having a hard time working. Unkindness. Everything is good here, but the bathroom is too poorly managed. There\\'s a fly dead in the sink. Why is the towel hanging next to you? Do you want me to share a towel with everyone? a gross dirty feeling in the bathroom. nan. It\\'s the best.. Four songs for 1,000 won. It\\'s cheap but the sound seems to be a little low.. Tropical fish is basic. Diverse aquatic organisms that are not easily encountered. Indoor aquarium. High quality coffee. A cafe where you can meet hand drips at a good price. A place where about 500 kinds of board games can be played. Pocketball for fun. A mini billiard room with four balls.  A favorite cafe to play board games. The place I often visit to play board games!  It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve been there.   I enjoyed Agricola, Winners Circle, Las Vegas, and Tichu.   I don\\'t think it\\'s a bad idea to ask you to recommend games to match the number of people who went with you for the first time.    I was recommended by Mr. Aza, so I got to know some famous games such as Powergrid and Abyss. There are a lot of guppies and other unique marine life in the aquarium. I used to go to Sillim-dong Board School often, but I couldn\\'t find the board game I was looking for, so I came here to see if there was any... There were even more fun games than that. The boss is good at recommending games. After playing a hard game, I counted the number of games during the break, and I counted it to 750 haha. The price here is cheap, the boss is kind and funny, and I love it. *^^*. I think I can study and enjoy my own time. But sometimes I get annoyed because I play popular music too loud. It would be nice to just play classical music or piano music, but it doesn\\'t suit the quiet and comfortable atmosphere, right? Except for that, it\\'s good to study, and it\\'s a good place to talk with friends. It\\'s close to Exit 4 of Gongneung Station.  To drink coffee.There are board games and cafes.It\\'s pretty and very crowded.It\\'s not. It was nice to talk about it.Coffee shot.Addable. 1500 won. Two shots if you addYou can add it. It\\'s the best. the most expensive and high-priced one. Dankke is fine, but iceblendid is expensive and small in quantity. Maybe it\\'s because it\\'s in front of the station. The coffee here is not good. No Matim. It\\'s a private store, but it\\'s not cheap. It\\'s the same as Tom Tam or franchise. Then why are you here?. Why can\\'t you turn off your bike? It is good to take a small walk. The view of the Han River is good to see while sitting, and the Garosu-gil, which has beautiful cherry blossoms in spring, is also pretty. I think the policy of preventing bicycles from penetrating the island was the best. It\\'s nice. There are places where the Han River looks wide and it\\'s good to go on a date. It\\'s spacious and nice. It\\'s a bit of a feeler. Beautiful green park and structures that glow even though they are old. Children\\'s slides are designed very harmoniously with the surrounding buildings! Don\\'t forget to bring your sand toys. They\\'re the best. Local residents just give five stars a night\\'s sleep. A mechanical location to visit is the best among parks. Beautiful green park and structures that glow even though they are old.

The weather is nice and nice, but don\\'t go to the shoes. It\\'s hard. Good. Memories made with my family. 夕日日園園. It\\'s the best. All right, all right. I feel good when I approach Seonyudo Park while crossing Seonyugyo Bridge. The park is vintage and has a unique atmosphere. Especially since I am in the middle of Han River, I like the view of Han River. Sperm was especially good! Good for a date. It\\'s the best. Good. Good.

A good place to take a picture and rest. It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. Sounds good. It\\'s good to take pictures and eat snacks at the snack bar or have chicken and beer and enjoy the scenery. It\\'s the best. The bridge on the way to Seonyudo Park! It\\'s good to take a walk unless it\\'s winter. A good place to see in summer and fall (only disabled vehicles are allowed inside the island...I think autumn will be better to walk around than hot summer, crossing the Seonyugyo Bridge and eating... The restaurant inside, Bisam...A lot... just coffee? Just a nice place to walk and take pictures... ...where you often go after lunch. Okay, I\\'m sorry I can\\'t go by car, but I\\'m very happy -- I\\'ll go with my son, I\\'ll miss parking. Good. 15.03.07 Seonyudo Park. I will bring a mat next time. I\\'m so excited that I\\'m running around. The weather is nice, cold, and nightlife. Plenty of flowers. 2014.09.03 꺅 Poop started rolling on the floor!! It\\'s a ginkgo tree. Please bear with me. It\\'s nasty just by looking at it. 15.03.07 Seonyudo Park. I will bring a mat next time. I\\'m so excited that I\\'m running around. The weather is nice, cold, and nightlife.

I often went there because they gave me one or two songs for free when the boss was there, but the facilities were very clean and the equipment was changed to a new one.. This cocktail is too much, and I\\'ll put it in the beer glass without sincerity, and I won\\'t have any basic snacks, so I won\\'t come again.^^. It\\'s too loud. There\\'s not much food, and it\\'s more like a space than a cafe.. nan. It\\'s closed.. It\\'s the best. Good. Free parking for Hyundai Card M3 Card 09:00 to 21:00 (November to March) 09:00 to 23:00 (April to October).. nan. cherry blossom petals. You\\'re crazy.. Okay, it\\'s normal. When I was young, I used to use the water. If it\\'s vacation, it\\'s summer vacation reading class.. It\\'s the best. There\\'s no staff at the counter, and I\\'m waiting for people to return their shoes, but no one comes. There\\'s a lot of new people coming in. I\\'m on business for a moment. I\\'ll be right back. Without a note like that, is it just an unmanned bowling? The facilities are neat and the elephant-like boss is kind. All right. Play bowling game and go shopping in Myeong-LOL. Thank you for visiting the Sumultibang. It would be nice to spend a time near the bus terminal that guarantees independence at this price, but there is nothing to do. I got a Wi-Fi password, but I can\\'t use it because of the low sensitivity. Lack of content, whether it\\'s a console or a movie. In the end, there\\'s nothing else to do but play a movie, but in terms of cost-effectiveness, a good evaluation cycle is just about right.. He\\'s so kind and the cafe is pretty. Good. The atmosphere here is nice, clean, and above all, kind. Nice drink. Kind. Some board game components are empty. I\\'m glad there\\'s no time limit. They say there aren\\'t many kinds of girlfriends. It\\'s the best.. They also give you a service and you\\'re kind. Your kindness, cleanliness, service is the best...If you\\'re happy, then you can play a service song.. I took my little brothers, but if they were quiet and good, there were not many snacks, and the soda was broken. Refrigerator drinks are cash only; I bought them at a convenience store. I went to a multi-room to take a rest for a while. I rested very comfortably. I played games because I was bored. It was so much fun, the facilities were good, the snack bar was good, and I think I\\'ll visit often. It was my first time in a multi-room, and it was nice to watch a movie with my boyfriend.It\\'s my first time playing Wii game and it\\'s so much fun. And internet, karaoke, movies...I always went to a cafe when I met my friend, but I fell in love with him because he wanted to try something else this time. The facilities are not bad and it tastes like popcorn. I\\'ve never been to a multi-room before, and it was great. I was happy to play Wii games and have popcorn, snacks, and drinks.This kitty room is so pretty. The weather was so hot that I was looking for a cool place, but I turned on the air conditioner, watched a movie, did the internet, and played with my friend as much as I could. It was even better to take Coco Punch and get a discount. I\\'ve been to a lot of multi-rooms in Sinchon, but MPlay seems to be the best. The facilities and employees have a good service mind, and I think I had a good time. Recommendation, boom boom. I think MPlay is very kind wherever you go. And the price is so nice that it\\'s good to play around without any burden. The price is cheap. Since there are many areas where discounts are offered, it\\'s good that you can choose according to your taste. The staff has a concept. We didn\\'t have We Game CD before, so I made a suggestion and they bought it right after. All right. I had a great time. Comfortable and good. It\\'s cheap and the staff is kind. But the room is a little small, so one point is deducted.. I don\\'t like it. I don\\'t like it. I don\\'t like the speaker, I don\\'t like the keyboard mouse. The price is similar to that of other places, and the service is similar, but you talk like you don\\'t have other services.. I liked the atmosphere of the store and the variety of games, but the best thing was that the CEO and the staff were so passionate. It\\'s a good place to explain well. I\\'ll go again next time.  I didn\\'t like board games, but I didn\\'t have a place to wait, so I went there for a day. It\\'s a place where I lost my schedule. It\\'s called Burmavlung, but I\\'ve been playing global board games for six hours. Mr. President, I didn\\'t know time was passing by because you were running a store. What is your favorite game genre? Just tell me and bring it to meet my needs.The downside is that I can\\'t manage my schedule because I don\\'t know how time is passing. It\\'s like the Dragon Ball Time Room. The store was very pleasant and the explanation was very interesting. There are many kinds of games and I have fun with my friends. I\\'ll be back next time. It was nice because the interior was cute and explained very kindly!!!. Is this place ruined?It\\'s about to be ground, but the fire is all gone and it smells quaint. The air wasn\\'t good in the basement, so the air wasn\\'t good, and after I came back, I was itchy and scratched to the dermatologist. Be careful.. Where is the entrance to the park? Is it under construction? It\\'s good to take a stroll in a stroller, smell the herbs, and get some fresh air. A good place to pack kimbap and go to a picnic. a herb-scented park. Mr. President, you\\'re awesome.. This is the part of the guide that says, \"Take your bike to the walking path.\" This is the part that I like the most, and it\\'s important to teach my children from an early age, but there\\'s a person who can\\'t handle the inconvenience and danger of others. Muy precioso! The best. Even the place to stay becomes a beautiful citizen.. I am satisfied with the clean atmosphere and low price. The boss is very kind too!!!. I went to number four. Why don\\'t you have a review? It\\'s so much fun here.. It\\'s the best.. A place in my memory. I remember playing with my friend in kindergarten. It used to be called Neighborhood Park, but it changed.. I can\\'t help but feel a little offended by the unkind service, even if I try to understand that you\\'re having a hard time working. Unkindness. Everything is good here, but the bathroom is too poorly managed. There\\'s a fly dead in the sink. Why is the towel hanging next to you? Do you want me to share a towel with everyone? a gross dirty feeling in the bathroom. The atmosphere was good. It was pretty good. But it\\'s cheap. It\\'s a comic book cafe with less comic books than I thought, and it\\'s so cold that I have to pay for my seat on the weekend. When you go out, you have to put your food at the counter and return it.  I saw an employee lying down after eating ramen at a cartoon. I\\'ve seen a couple of customers just go looking for a seat. The book type is too small to be true and the price of an unbelievable expensive seat... People who like Simpson are worth a visit! I look at the interior and take pictures, but I don\\'t think I\\'ll go twice. It\\'s normal. Each person has to choose a drink or menu for an hour and 5,000 won. LOL. The staff who is not very kind... There\\'s almost no such thing Man\\'s favorite comic book. No comic book. It\\'s a seat price. It\\'s so cold that it comes out in an hour.. The boss is kind and the rice is delicious. And iced tea for free.You\\'re the best. It\\'s comfortable and tteokbokki is... Delicious. The boss is good at explaining and kind. I like reading books quietly, but I don\\'t have many...  I can\\'t see it because there\\'s no war between the War...  I was just reading a travel book.  Size is not wide... Moreover, one side has a pile of furniture to clean up something... I don\\'t think we have much consideration for our customers. Kindness to the boss.. It\\'s the best. The coffee is really delicious. He\\'s even kind. H. Coffee restaurant. I like the taste of coffee and the Affogato is good too. ... 와 와 Come here!!!!! The place where the owner himself stir-fries coffee.. nan. nan. It\\'s good for kids to play. It\\'s not that crowded.. It\\'s the best.. Okay.. Oyesum tayaji. Five thousand won songs, Geumyeong and Taejin are both available, it\\'s cold, and all three remote control rooms are not working properly. Not managed at all Dirty. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s expensive, but I like it because it\\'s comfortable and there are so many comic books. It\\'s well managed and comfortable. The downside is that the smoking room is on the roof of the building. The price has gone up by 5000 won. You\\'re the best.. It\\'s normal.. I\\'ve come to Nowon Room Escape, and there\\'s a story that\\'s the best here, and it\\'s fun and the staff is kind!  I\\'m not leaving a review because you gave me a service. It\\'s so much fun! The staff is so cute and kind! It was fun. Datu Datu First Datu. nan. Okay, don\\'t come if you don\\'t want to, you two. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. All right. Make sure you open the mat and eat ramen. It\\'s better to go to the night market when we do it\\'s. If you think of Seoul, you don\\'t have to go to the Han River, you don\\'t have to go to the sea of Seoul, you don\\'t have to think about spacing out in a place where the Han River itself is as big as the sea, you don\\'t have time to be bored as you can, like cleaning up your thoughts, enjoying the sun, riding bicycles, and running. It\\'s the best. It\\'s delicious if you eat it here. ᅮᅮ. A cool place. Spread the mat and make sure you eat ramen. It\\'s better to go to the night market when we do it together. If you think of Seoul, you don\\'t have to go to the Han River, you don\\'t have to go to the sea of Seoul, you don\\'t have to think about spacing out in a place where the Han River itself is as big as the sea, you don\\'t have time to be bored as you can, like cleaning up your thoughts, enjoying the sun, riding bicycles, and running.

Preparing for the weather chicken walk. Perfect. September 14th. All right, all right. It\\'s chilly now. Memories. September 14... All right, all right. It\\'s chilly now. Memories. Lying in the Han River for two days in a row, watching videos, reading books, eating, sleeping, and photosynthesis, which is good for treating depression, also recharged body and mind, and shared healing.  If life is a marathon, I think this is a time to take a breath for a while. Few people have made lunch boxes, packed fans, and even packed speakers and electronic devices. Four-hour transfer is the best spot. Sometimes, I know, but I know it\\'s certainly not unreasonable for me, but there\\'s a time to try and ignore it for me or for the sake of the other person\\'s face.  On the other hand, there must have been some experience that someone did for me.Late at night, when I have a lot on my mind, on my way home...^^ -I think today is just a day like that. Everyone goes down to the countryside and takes an empty highway to the Han River in 20 minutes, buys chicken and snacks, and enjoy the first day of the holiday. You can see the full moon and the weather is cool and fresh. September 14th. Am I doing yoga to eat? I definitely ate a hamburger set at work. Yoga and tteok-bokki. But it\\'s delicious. > The long Han River is as good as the sea. Good night on the 13th. Nan. If you lie down in a tent, you\\'ll fall on earth. It\\'s so pretty here. If you find a relaxing night. Han River in Yeouido, Park With Beer and Chicken!!!-. Tentchiger beer. a summer resort in downtown Seoul My favorite place in Seoul. Han River. 2013.05.24 Han River Date with Jihyun. In the summer, we\\'ll bring up tents. In spring, I go to play badminton like a frog woke up from hibernation, and when I\\'m tired, I lie down and sleep, and if I\\'m hungry, I order a Chinese restaurant and spend a day. Please take care of me this spring. It\\'s so fun to rent a bicycle and go around once. However, it is better to avoid the cherry blossom season in Yunjung-ro. You might get trampled while lying down.

The facilities are good and everything is good, but my eyes hurt because of the dim lighting in the book reading area and the sound of the song is so loud that it bothers me when I read the book. If you drink only and don\\'t eat anything, it\\'s not that wide. Books aren\\'t diverse.. There was a female part-timer, but she didn\\'t ask how many people there are and didn\\'t explain the price. I asked you to explain the game, and you said there\\'s no one to explain it to me because the boss isn\\'t here. There are about six to seven part-timers in the hall talking together, and when I went to pay, I was poker-chipping and standing up. It\\'s just a flash and it\\'s really bad. The drinks are not good for the price. I was happy that the boss was so kind, but... I don\\'t think the female part-timer is cheap.. The facilities are good. Okay, that\\'s normal. Okay, I don\\'t like it. Good. That was good It was good. It was good. April 19, 2013 Bowling! I didn\\'t meet you to play this, but I went to the bowling alley and was swinging my second round. My shoulders, arms, waist, and neck hurt. I\\'m old now. 108 points.... There are many kinds of board games, and there are friends who play board games as if they are at a Korean restaurant. Part-timers are also very good at board games and have all the Mensa Recommendation Games series. It\\'s cheap, but you don\\'t know how much time passes, so you spend all your money.. It\\'s not delicious and In Seong says everything. The atmosphere was nice and the cookies you gave me were very delicious! I will visit often! You\\'re crazy, you\\'re talking down to me for the first time -- no matter what you do with that personality.. a park close to Yeomkyung Elementary School. Skip it when two people go. On the weekend, there were so many customers in the business that there were seven empty tables for four people, but I left them waiting for two people to be seated, and three of them were given seats.There aren\\'t many kinds of games, but there are plenty of seats. The interior is a bit desolate, but the bathroom is clean and there is no problem with the game. It\\'s a waste of a single star. Even if the bathroom is blocked, you don\\'t have to solve it, and you don\\'t have to find the game. They didn\\'t even understand the explanation, so I searched and looked it up myself. There is a reason not to go ᅮI hope you improve your service. Some games don\\'t have different kinds of games that can or can\\'t be explained and smell.. Okay, I\\'m a little sad. I love it. I love going out. a writing shrine for schools in Seocho-gu The scenery is nice. It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. The park is very large. Especially when cherry blossoms bloom, it is very pretty. a forest of Yangjae citizens It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. All right, all right.

Comfortable in the city.~Paid parking. Ohh. Test. It\\'s good to exercise near your house.At least there\\'s a forest like Thank you. It\\'s all good, but I don\\'t know if the streetlights are installed... It\\'s dark. There are few people at night, and it\\'s a little scary. Picnic. Very quiet and nice place. Hahahaha. It\\'s a good walk, but it\\'s by the highway, so the sound of cars...A book and a can of coffee are enough. Company. Metasequoire Road. Green healing in the forest. The forest is so nice. It\\'s even better when it blooms in spring. I\\'m walking on this street, where the spring breeze is blowing and the cherry blossoms are blowing. Oh yeah, you, you. The place I\\'m going to count this time is...! The forest is so close, so it\\'s a great place to go on an outing, Yangjae Citizens\\' Forest!!! I\\'m surprised there was such a peaceful rest area in the city.^^ Admission is free!!! Car? I don\\'t need it!!! Come visit Yangjae Citizen\\'s Forest, which is so close and nice! 5 minutes walk from our company_Yangjae Citizen Forest. A good place to take a quiet stroll. It\\'s good to go when it\\'s quiet. Good. Not bad. It\\'s perfect to take a rest, but it\\'s a very normal space, so I don\\'t think there\\'s anything special to do. I\\'d like to say it\\'s a stopover. Test. It\\'s good to exercise near home.At least there\\'s a forest like Thank you. It\\'s all good, but I don\\'t know if the streetlights are installed... It\\'s dark. There are few people at night, and it\\'s a little scary. Picnic. The boss is kind and it hasn\\'t been long since it was created, so the facilities are clean, so it\\'s good. And there\\'s a separate space, so it\\'s good for a couple date! I liked the clean and pleasant atmosphere.. It was a shame that the first part of Dragon Ball was torn to a considerable extent.The atmosphere is good. It\\'s good, but I don\\'t have any books. The best cartoon cafe I\\'ve ever been to!. Cozy and friendly. It\\'s normal. It\\'s the best. I\\'ve been a regular for 3 years. I like roasting coffee. It\\'s fresh because it has a good rotation rate. I can\\'t go often, but I go whenever I think of coffee. It\\'s more delicious than an antler site, and some people get roasted beans here at other cafes nearby. Woonggon, fighting!!! Magpie Mountain Coffee Prince who sang with Fantastic Duo Kim Soohee!. This park near the Han River can rest comfortably... Good. Convenience stores are well-organized and convenient for each person on weekdays. I like the Han River because it looks wide. The parking lot and amenities (toilet, convenience store) are all good. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Our town. Good. These days, I like Han River the best. Free parking for Hyundai Card M3 Card 09:00 to 21:00 (November to March) 09:00 to 23:00 (April to October). It\\'s the best. Our village. I like it. I like Han River the most these days. Free parking for Hyundai Card M3 Card 09:00 to 21:00 (November to March) 09:00 to 23:00 (April to October).. nan. I\\'m a little sad. I come here often, but I don\\'t like working with the attitude of part-timers. I have two or three teams of people who work during the day on May 22, and I have a lot of people waiting, but I don\\'t have to take my girlfriend out in the middle, so I just use my cell phone without waiting.. 3,000 won, one hour. Do you need another word? It\\'s the best.. I\\'ve been to a lot of other comic cafe chains, but I really didn\\'t like being stuck in a small space. There\\'s plenty of space here, lots of books, and the sofa bed is the most comfortable. I\\'ve been sleeping It\\'s not set at all.I was wondering where they went because there were no 123 books, but they were packed in another bookcase, and there were other books that should be in the webtoon box, but there were many books that were not organized, so I couldn\\'t see them.. Just so-so. I\\'m so disappointed. It\\'s not the old AP. If you\\'re unfriendly, your service is terrible, and your old AP is 95, you\\'re wasting 10 points on your current APs.. I tried to find it, but it\\'s not there. We have comic, pure, webtoons, adults, one-day cartoons, fantasy, martial arts, and a large number of sections and new books. The business hours are from 9 am to 12 pm. 070 7555 8722. I don\\'t like it. It\\'s the best.. I think the machine is better than the other branch. It was the best Mr. Healing store I\\'ve ever been to.. It\\'s the worst. It\\'s old and the cigarette smell is so bad that I came back out. The cigarette smell is really bad. Not pleasant. I\\'m a little sad. Q+ multi-room that I use every time I go to Gangnam. These days, I use 10,000 won for 3 hours.  It\\'s 3,300 won per hour, so it\\'s cheaper than anywhere else. You must try it when you come to Gangnam.. If you have a lot of comic books in the old comic book store, you can deliver food and bring in foreign food (there are so many menus such as sundae bokkeum, jokbal, chicken restaurant, etc. near the comic book store) Ramen is also made for 1,000 won per hour. There are many different kinds of books, so I like it.. I like the interior. The part-timers are kind and the hairy guy explains the game, and it\\'s easy to understand. And I like it because there are various kinds of games. There are many kinds of games and the part-timers are very kind! The part-timers are pretty and handsome!!! It\\'s so good to play with friends and lovers!!! From now on, I think I\\'m only going to go to board game rooms. The part-timers are so kind and nice! It looked good because there was a two-person table covered by a wall! Even if I asked them to explain the game, they didn\\'t bother me and did a good job. And I just ordered a chocolate latte, and it was nice to have a smile on my face. The other drinks were good, too. I think I\\'ll take my friends with me again. Please explain the game well and the game was so diverse that I didn\\'t know time was passing. It was a bright atmosphere, so it was nice!. It\\'s normal.. Cool in summer and warm in winter. Water is also served in a certain time.. It\\'s not good. It\\'s good to play with dogs. There are many dogs between 7 and 9 p.m. on weekdays.. nan. It\\'s the best. It\\'s just as pretty as Eungbong Mountain Forsythia. The view is great. a rest area in the city It\\'s not high. It\\'s cool.. Facilities, the game is too old. The female part-timer\\'s explanation was really neat and I understood it right away. But the short guy with glasses on... He\\'s been tirking since we came in, and he\\'s been looking at his cell phone. If you don\\'t want to work, you can stop. Everyone except the part-timer was kind. It\\'s neat and has a menu, so it\\'s good to choose. All right, all right.. All right, all right. It\\'s okay to walk. Okay.. The facilities are old, but above all, the part-timers are very unfriendly. Especially, when giving a room escape hint, it is heard directly from a part-timer through a walkie-talkie, and he gives a hint, and answers the question very insincerely. I visited on the evening of the 23rd and if the boss is watching it in person, it seems urgent to train part-timers or replace them. I don\\'t call you a king, but I think there is a basic treatment that you have to pay a considerable amount of 44,000 won. Please don\\'t take this lightly and consider it. Folding. I went early today. It was harder than I thought. I was able to enjoy the process because the staff explained it well. I think you could give me a raise. ^^. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s cozy and nice.. It\\'s neat. Good, good, good. It was really clean and nice of the boss:-) It was Friday, so we had to wait for a long time. I like it because it\\'s neat.. The facilities are good, the UPro is kind and everything is good, but the staff is rude and the resident team is ignoring it. When it\\'s dirty, it feels very different. These days, there are some lane problems in FinSetter, and one or two employees are quick and kind, but most other employees are very lazy and insincere. Please change your mind if you feel guilty while watching the review. Thanks to you, the good bowling alley is falling apart and the rumors are getting worse.Folding. The service feels bad. The staff is so unfriendly that I don\\'t want to go again. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s good to take a walk quietly. It\\'s fun to find hidden rabbits. Rabbits are good. I saw three rabbits. They were cute. Look at the dog, take a picture, and take the owner\\'s permission. It was hard to touch the rabbit, but I took a lot of pictures. It\\'s nice. The air is nice, too. The playground of the cute rabbits Please protect the rabbit here. Please don\\'t scare the rabbit who sleeps during the day. Please don\\'t give me snacks or food. (Rabbits are herbivores.) It\\'s quiet and quiet, so it\\'s perfect to think about things alone or walk with your lover. I\\'m a little out of breath going up, but I can see rabbits from time to time.Please protect the rabbit here. Please don\\'t scare the rabbit who sleeps during the day. Please don\\'t give me snacks or food. (Rabbit is a herbivore). I think I went to Japan for a short time. It\\'s a small prop and I remember the owner\\'s dessert skills.. It was fun, but the staff made it so difficult to explain. I was sad... But it was good!! The interior is pretty. Best board game location!!!!. There are not many books, but you managed them well and the inside is cozy and nice. be cheaper than a franchise. Of course, people who like dogs will like it, and it\\'s comfortable because there\\'s a bed. But the taste and price of drinks and desserts are not very... Ha Se-young sometimes visits healing to cheer up. The atmosphere is nice and I\\'m raising a dog in the cafe, but it doesn\\'t smell. It\\'s comfortable~. five songs for one thousand won. There are many interesting comic books and good atmosphere and there are many new books, but the downside is that the bathroom is outside and the windows are open, so it\\'s scary for a woman to go to the bathroom alone.. It\\'s a new one, so it\\'s clean and drowsy. card game exciting till dawn. It\\'s the best, artificial lake, different plaza.. I\\'ve been there so many times, but I can see that it\\'s getting more and more unmanageable....Don\\'t order Nolmuk Tteokbokki anywhere because it\\'s no good, especially cream Tteokbokki is really bad objectively. The attic downstairs is all cobwebs, so I sat in an open space, and the spiders crawling next to me...It\\'s not like I haven\\'t cleaned for a day or two, but the cushion cushion is full of smell. There are a lot of books and the staff is kind.It\\'s good to go in and rest when it\\'s hot! I went at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, but it\\'s not open. Please modify the open time information. I like the facilities and comic books, but I don\\'t want to come again because of the part-timer. When I asked the part-timer what he asked, he didn\\'t answer, and I asked him again, and he said, \"I didn\\'t feel good about it.\" Okay, it\\'s normal. Oh, that\\'s great! There are a lot of the same play forest, but it\\'s an incomparable class. Sinchon nori was not popular in Facebook for no reason...!! It seems that the Ewha Womans University branch was small and unfriendly...I\\'m touched!. It is a pathetic bowling alley where counter employees use their strength and power over their customers\\' necks, rather than being kind. Wow, I like this big bowling alley. The facilities are neat and well. I like it best that it is divided into two parts. You\\'re the best. Good. You\\'re the best.^^The 6th floor has a huge scale.It\\'s European-style streets, and it\\'s killing the window-Nice lane, too.^^. It\\'s nice here~ They give us 5,000 won worth of service. Boss is kind. It costs 5,000 won for an hour and gets a lot of service. I\\'ve been to many other places in Hongdae. I\\'ve been to coin karaoke a lot, but it\\'s not that bad, but I think it\\'s okay here.. I don\\'t like it. It\\'s the best.. I\\'ve done a lot of room escape so far, and the second-floor hallway end toilet is the number one horror theme, and there are five stars.. I don\\'t like it. I recorded it and e-mailed it, but it didn\\'t come... You\\'ve been tricked. It doesn\\'t seem to have any transmission function at all. The facility is bad, but four songs cost 1,000 won. There are three nearby, and this is the worst facility. Late years come first while waiting. Tell Alba to come out. I didn\\'t even put the money in, but I didn\\'t know you were here first. Don\\'t you know how to ask if you don\\'t know the order?. Feels like a secret hideout. Good. Ramen restaurants.. Some of them were untangled in the middle, and the explanation was a little weird. One of the part-timers was kind, but the person who explained it to us was very unfriendly. It\\'s not good. The quality is so bad. I\\'d rather go somewhere else. I haven\\'t been immersed since the beginning. I didn\\'t start with an eye patch on, and I didn\\'t explain it well, so I had a hard time without basic supplies. People are kind!!. It\\'s not easy to find a good restaurant for Ein Spener, but it was so delicious that it was worth coming from Nonsan.^^. Normal.. I don\\'t want to go to the bathroom because it smells so bad. It\\'s spacious and pleasant, but I often hear the sound of game consoles or group chatter, so the staff only warn me when it\\'s really bad. If you order too late, you can tell you that you can\\'t make the menu due to lack of ingredients, and if you change it, the other menu you ordered before will be omitted. Looking at other reviews, I don\\'t think I\\'m the only one...It doesn\\'t taste like food, but if you\\'re just going to watch a cartoon, just go. The coffee machine is broken, the game machine is broken, and I was going to watch a movie, but Wi-Fi is broken, so I only watch real cartoons.. The air is stuffy due to poor ventilation and cleaning, the microphone speaker is not in good condition, and the lighting is 1,000 won for 3 songs. three thousand won songs. Come to Laputa where you want to have a unique date in Cheonho-dong, or where you can have friendship with your friends, and love with your lover, you can have delicious tea, drink drinks, play board games, put puzzles together, and see your mascot, pretty happy. Hello, this is Laputa board game puzzle cafe. It is the only board game, puzzle cafe, which has been located in Cheonho-dong for 14 years.   Maybe he didn\\'t know the game well because he was a shopkeeper. I\\'m sorry for your difficult step.  I\\'ll recommend you a fun game next time you come. ^^. I came here to play a board game, and I paid in advance for drinks, but I only have two or three games that the boss knows.I\\'m so annoyed that I only paid for the drink and got the rest of the refund, so I don\\'t have this rating left, but I\\'m leaving it because I\\'m mad. Matiz puppy is very cute.. I go there often because there is a playground and a few sports equipment. The playground is always crowded because there are many babies in the neighborhood.. nan. nan. Just like when I was young. I like it because it\\'s quiet.. There are two part-timers, and they arrived 10 minutes ago, but they can\\'t wait. They told me to wait outside, so I shivered outside on a cold day and canceled; I couldn\\'t let them sit inside even though there was a seat. -- I don\\'t like it. Quality....Lee Ha-im. No logic. I\\'m getting the answer. How absurd? I don\\'t know what the logic is.You\\'re paying me for this? Whether it\\'s the concept or the original, the smell of the sewer is so unpleasant. I found the key, but it didn\\'t work, so I wasted a lot of time. In conclusion, it\\'s not funny. There\\'s only one hint for three. There\\'s no more.There are some people who try to add a hint, and I asked them to give me a hint because it\\'s a difficult step, and they said it\\'s like asking for the right answer. Even if it\\'s just a rule, it takes a few minutes because there is no important UV lamp battery inside; the connection between the problems seems to be a little off. It would be better to have more room escape cafes at Jonggak. The owner is very rude and boring. I couldn\\'t help but write when I didn\\'t write anything like this.I played room escape game in Daehangno before and it was fun so I went here and lost 40,000 won. There\\'s no probability in the story.\\'Ha\\' came out with a feeling of mystery.. I moved around and looked for a place nearby first. I think Sambo here is the perfect place to go with the children. I like the facilities and the price, and above all, the employees are so kind that I went bowling happily. Oh, my God! I\\'ve discovered a whole new world. I was so busy raising my kids that I got together with my college classmates and they\\'re all relieved of their stress!I made an appointment to see you again next month. It\\'s been a while since I had so much fun!!!LOL I\\'m right in front of my house, so I play bowling a lot with my friends for fun. The boss is kind and now I go there often, so I think I go there more often because they recognize me as a regular customer. I\\'m having a good time every time I go there often with my friends, and the facilities are so nice.lol lol lol I think I should go this week.I recommend it. Located in the eastern market of Jungwha-dong.These days, the place is decorated with glow-in-the-dark and has a lot of fun with exciting music. It\\'s a fun place to go bowling, except that it\\'s a little far from my neighborhood. Rock bowling... The reason why I like glow-in-the-dark bowling is because it\\'s exciting and fun. It\\'s near the eastern market and it\\'s good to go with my friends sometimes. It\\'s not close to my neighborhood because it\\'s Myeonmok-dong, but I think it\\'s the best place to go rock bowling! There aren\\'t many rock bowling alley... Oh, I was going to go bowling in Myeonmok-dong a while ago.Why didn\\'t you come here then? I\\'ll be there next time. I was looking for a bowling alley. The music is exciting and shiny. I heard there\\'s a rock bowling alley in Gangnam. I heard that there\\'s a rock bowling alley in Jungnang-gu. It\\'s clean and nice, maybe because it\\'s been refurbished. Shoes are glow-in-the-dark and the sense of spraying Febreze with new ones. I love it.I was wondering if rock bowling was far away and it was glow-in-the-dark bowling? That\\'s how I looked for the glow-in-the-dark bowling alley.I didn\\'t know there was so much information here.I\\'m going to play soon. I didn\\'t know there was a rock bowling alley in Myeonmok-dong.I\\'ll have to visit you soon. It\\'s rare to find a place like this. I wanted to play field bowling.I was looking for it, and I went... I think it\\'s good to stop by regardless of the time. It\\'s late-night business, so I went after the company dinner...It\\'s so good to go at night!!!!!! Wow!. nan. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s nice to be quiet. If no one knew. Is it ruined? a foot in the door. I\\'ve always felt like a boring date, but it\\'s fresh and amazing. I had so much fun.GFRIEND likes it betterI will come often! The counters are very kind, and the most well-organized and well-organized in Daehangno Room Escape. Why are you so annoying when you come in at the end? That\\'s too much! He\\'s not coming again! It was the first time I went to an escape room cafe and it was fun. Every time I went on the same date course, I had a lot of fun. Make sure to go. It\\'s going to be fun! First of all, I was glad that the people at the counter were so kind. I liked it because it was full of contents and the interior was pretty. I went with my boyfriend and it\\'s so much fun. I strongly recommend it! That\\'s thrilling!! I had fun with my friends. I had a lot of fun.I went to play with my boyfriend and it was so much fun!! I\\'ll go to the other room again!. Kindness good to be alone. As soon as I received the drink, I realized why you said part-time jobs are rude. I went Sunday, and the part-timer was the worst part-time job I\\'ve ever seen in my life. Really. It\\'s 14,000 won for 2 people in cash for 2 hours, but I was going to get out when I was told to. It\\'s 9,000 won for 1 hour. It\\'s 10,000 won for 2 people and 9,000 won for 1 hour. It\\'s not very sanitary, it\\'s not good for a board game, it\\'s not good for a drink.. The boss is kind and clean inside!. Jogging haha. The last one in the president\\'s study was open, so I got confused. I had so much fun in the vampire room. It was fun to be active and it was good to be focused on equipment. I\\'ve tried treasure and Dracula, and I recommend this place for those who like devices with fewer locks! The staff aren\\'t that kind, so we\\'ll take out a star. The lost treasure theme was fun! It\\'s normal.. a sudden welcome. I like the theme here. The facilities are cleaner than other places. The facilities were nice because they were clean and the staff was kind. I used a short sleep theme, and the story and components were all good. It\\'s kind of you. Recommend a short sleep theme. The theme was good, but the staff wasn\\'t good. He was a male and female employee, but he couldn\\'t explain anything properly and was sloppy. I didn\\'t give you any hints quickly, but the staff blamed me for the time. Each theme is a great place for Sherlock. Personally, I think that Sinchon branch and this place are the two major mountains.. I don\\'t like it because the bathroom is too small to sit down and the gap between the tables playing board games is narrow. The store is luxurious and nice.. The rooms here are well managed and the part-timers are the best... I left the cash on the machine without knowing it, but it\\'s still in the warehouse. Thank you so much. There was no problem with the sound system. However, I wanted to get a refund from a part-timer because the machine in room 12 ate money, but no one was there. I played in Room 10 for an hour, but there was no part-timer when I left... In the end, I didn\\'t get a refund... It\\'s a small sum of 1,000 won, so I\\'ll just go. I visited around 5:29 p.m. on May 9 and left at 6:36. Check out the CCTV.. The boss is kind and very clean. I\\'ll go again next time. The boss is kind and has a good voice. It\\'s clean and nice.. I like the price because it\\'s cheap, but this is the peak of unkindness of the Pro Shop contractor... I recommend you to go to a different shop. The facilities are too old.  I can\\'t take care of the rain. Just go to Cheonho bowling alley or royal bowling alley nearby. I\\'m a little sad. Dancenta is not a rock bowling alley. The game fee for closing until 10 to 01 on the basement floor is 4,000 won after 6 p.m. on weekdays, 4,000 won for weekend holidays, 1,000 won for shoes, all year round.  I also get a reservation. Hello.The bowling alley on the 1st basement floor of the Daeryong building has a parking lot up to the 4th basement floor, and the 12-lane lighting has been changed to L.E.D. so the atmosphere is good.To ensure that there is no inconvenience in using it, we will use a large L.E.D. on the Scua screen.I\\'ll always be with you as a family.. You\\'re very unkind. The seats are also very uncomfortable. I don\\'t think I\\'ll come back. The space is sensuous and good to work on, but the Wi-Fi is too slow. It\\'s the best. Good. The space is so nice, but I think coffee is normal!!! If you\\'re not sensitive to coffee, I recommend you!!! I think it\\'s the best cafe to visit in Hapjeong!  I want to go again. 인테리어^. Cafe interior! It\\'s full of sophistication! Lemon Cherryade was so delicious, too!. nan. View!. All right. Maybe I\\'m stupid because it\\'s hard. LOL. Failed to escape. The difficulty was pretty high, but I\\'m proud that I passed.. It\\'s the best. My bowling club performance. The bowling alley in the neighborhood has doubled the number of customers since the refurbishment! I\\'m excited to change like a clown. The facilities are so neat. You can go bowling with girls.야^The glow of the night light makes me feel more excited!!I sometimes use it with my friends. I heard you can find it if you search it, so I think it\\'s rude to just go, so I\\'m leaving my rating behind. The facilities are clean, the part-timers and the boss are kind and good.. There are two part-timers, and they arrived 10 minutes ago, but they can\\'t wait. They told me to wait outside, so I shivered outside on a cold day and canceled; I couldn\\'t let them sit inside even though there was a seat. -- I don\\'t like it. Quality....Lee Ha-im. No logic.

There\\'s no probability in the story.\\'Ha\\' came out with a feeling of mystery.. I think it\\'s a good place to walk. Especially, it\\'s nice to have a tower at the top. It\\'s the best. Let\\'s go around the neighborhood together!. It\\'s a waste of one point. The Internet specifications are Windows XP, so it\\'s a basic thing to be slow, and there\\'s not much games, so I feel like I\\'m losing money.. It\\'s fun. The scenery is nice, but no Cheolbong.ᅲ. I like everything, but I don\\'t have many books, I don\\'t have the latest books, and I like it because there are many seats, but I really don\\'t have many books. It\\'s the best. All the employees look like they don\\'t want to work and the room is a little small, so it\\'s uncomfortable.I prefer the Hongdae Nolreuk Forest. You changed your part-time job.The lady wearing glasses is so very kind!Facilities are the best. You need to train your employees. I was especially offended by the fact that the female staff seemed to be annoyed. I don\\'t want to go again... an unkind male worker If you speak to yourself like you\\'re muttering and ask again, your face will be stiff. I came here because of the good reviews, but I won\\'t come back again. The price is good and a good place to come with your girlfriend. Nice facilities and new comic books! Good. Walk and come when you have a hard time. It\\'s the best. There\\'s a lot to do and it\\'s good to rest. I\\'m sitting in a cave room, so I can lie down and give you a piggyback ride.It\\'s a true healer.Even the food is delicious.~Taking the time off!. I found a nice board cafe after a long time. The table is large and the game is well managed, so it\\'s neat. It was good because you explained it well and the games were all difficult: I guess it hasn\\'t been long since it opened. The board games are very clean. One drink per person is not required. He also explains the game rules meticulously.~. The best.. It\\'s just a normal... I was surprised to smell mold on the stairs when I went underground. Inside the cafe, the scent of the air freshener was so strong that it was a little uncomfortable. This is fine. It\\'s better than Nolmook. It is relatively cheap at 1,800 won per hour. I think it\\'s okay here. There are a lot of cartoons. Exit 1 of Hwagok Station http://blog.naver.com/manwawalking. It\\'s the best.. The boss is so kind and the price is cheaper than around him. He\\'s so kind. The room is so neat. There are so many kinds of books and I\\'m searching for what I want to see, so they helped me find them. It\\'s 4,500 won for tteokbokki, and the amount is not good and the taste is not good. When I heard the cushion in my room, it\\'s hard to organize what others use, even if there are things inside, don\\'t come back. It smells........ It\\'s not cheap, but it\\'s comfortable and good.. The service is fine, but I can smell the air. There are so many kinds of games and they make it easy to understand the explanation, so it\\'s easy to play games for the first time! And it\\'s only 1,500 won per hour, so it\\'s good that it\\'s not too much to play for a long time.~~. I\\'ve done a lot of room escape so far, and the second-floor hallway end toilet is the number one horror theme, and there are five stars.. Tangle\\'s 2nd Seoul Ultra Rally 13km Challenge. nan. Employees are kind, but the game itself is not good. Overall, there are many kinds of quizzes and the story and quiz don\\'t mix well. It\\'s more like solving a quiz itself. If you\\'re not that active even though you\\'ve done the best theme, you\\'ll be able to hear a few hints about moving two or three rooms. I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. No fun, no... It\\'s the best.. It\\'s expensive, and the female president introduces us to not having a seat so we can keep you waiting, but if you don\\'t ask first, we let people in. I don\\'t want to go twice. Kind and cozy. Boss, you\\'re kind and comfortable. I like it. It\\'s a bit more crazy than other places.. There are many things to play besides bowling and the bowling alley facilities are neat and nice. When you pay for bottled beer here, look at the menu in advance and make a calculation and make sure to match. I paid for a 25,000 won card for three bottles of beer, but I checked the menu later and it was 20,000 won worth...  It\\'s been a while, and I don\\'t have a receipt.  If the customer feels like he\\'s drunk, he\\'s either ripped off, or the counter part-timer just comes out thinking he\\'s not good enough to pay. I went to play with my friends and I liked it because it was very clean and well-equipped.I just have a lot of customers, so it would be better to call in advance.*^^*~~. The staff kindly showed me around, and I had a lot of fun with my friends all night long:) I\\'m going to play again before the winter vacation is over:) The Key Lab party room was the best! I had a great time.Haha. It\\'s the best. It\\'s hard to climb up the hill, but the night view is the best. It\\'s hard to climb up the hill.. landscaping, neighborhood commercial facilities It\\'s normal. I\\'d be happy if it wasn\\'t for the weekend. All right, all right. mineral water. nan Samcheong Park is beautiful in all four seasons, but it is the most beautiful these days. a milky atmosphere Well, don\\'t take your car. I regret it.. Don\\'t speak informally because you look young. I feel bad. I\\'m not here to hang out at someone else\\'s house, so I don\\'t have to talk down to my boss. I don\\'t think I\\'ll go back after I finish my drink. Mr. President is a bad guy. I hope he ran a ripple. I like Mr. Nam. I\\'m surprised to hear all the bad things. I have to wait a long time when I order a drink, but it didn\\'t bother me much. The impression of a male CEO is also not good. It\\'s a place that makes you feel bad. Where to go if you need a quiet place urgently. It\\'s clean, kind, and has many kinds.. I like it because it\\'s quiet.. This is TJ machine karaoke. There are places where you can take off your shoes for 1,000 won.. It\\'s the best. It sells beer and seats are comfortable. I think it\\'s good to stay up all night or rest. It\\'s my regular bread that dingles and relaxes every weekend.^ There are a lot of comic books, the price is very nice, and there is always good music, and news of new comics is posted on Facebook every day~ I strongly recommend 5 stars.^^*. I went to Seodaemun-gu because it was my first time. It\\'s a newly opened place, so it\\'s bright and clean and friendly.~~. It\\'s the best.. Clean, friendly staff, diverse food. I\\'d like to give you a zero here. He said he\\'d get cash from a group customer to steal money and he wouldn\\'t even give him a cash receipt!!! Somebody please report it. I think we should look into this. Reserved customers want 12,000 won for two games.He\\'s a thief. I don\\'t want to give you a point. I used it around 9 p.m. on May 14, but the male part-timer is really unkind. That\\'s unpleasant. I asked them to refrain from coming in as a group of people on the side, but the part-timer pretended to hear me. With a pooch-cheeked face and a tone that says he\\'s not my part-time job. It\\'s not his jurisdiction. The service is the worst. If you\\'re going to do this again, I won\\'t use it. Complete light. Use another place.. nan. It\\'s very expensive. I can\\'t drink because I\\'m not feeling well, but I have to drink per person. They said no coke. I didn\\'t like to pick up the ball that was ground in some asphalt. If you want to go somewhere else, you\\'d rather... The store was clean, pretty, and the staff was kind, so I took my friend for the first time, and it was great. The cocktail was delicious. Thanks to the friendly staff and hip atmosphere, we had a lot of fun. I had a great time. Wow, it\\'s really expensive. Three people came out for two games at 70,000 won. It\\'s much cheaper to just take a taxi and go somewhere else. I went to the third round in the morning, and it was 30,000 won per person, and I could drink beer and bowl without limit. I didn\\'t have one before, but I think unlimited is fine. I\\'ll have to come here often Wow, it\\'s my first time going there and the interior and lighting are pretty. There\\'s Hulk Stachu and bowling and taking pictures are good. They sell pretty cocktails at the bowling alley, and it tastes great. The staff are so kind and the atmosphere is great!!I\\'ve never seen such a nice bowling alley. It\\'s opened in Cheongdam, so I must go there. It\\'s a bowling alley and it\\'s expensive. I don\\'t know if it\\'s not... Not so kind and expensive as Zuo You\\'d better not go bowling. Nice and clean!! I have to order a drink. The cheapest bowling alley starts at 9000 won. The rock bowling alley between Jongno 2-ga and Jonggak has a good atmosphere, and the music...I don\\'t know if it\\'s good, but you play loud things that go well with the rock bowling alley. We have to order drinks per person and the price of drinks is a little high. We order a simple meal for three and it will cost about 80,000 won for two games. We need to win the bet.. I\\'m only looking at the unkind cell phone of a part-timer, and I didn\\'t set it up in advance. I booked a study room for the first time in Hongdae, but I\\'m disappointed in many ways. The boss is so kind and nice to do something together. Recently, we rented a group store on the 2nd floor, and the atmosphere was great! I\\'m here for a fan meeting for a child actor. It\\'s a great facility and a great place to discuss.  But the cafe lasuga is a hot bath. I love whiteboard walls!He had beams and everything he needed. I\\'m going to use it. It\\'s cozy, so it\\'s good to read books and chat. It was amazing that there was a place like this in Hongdae.. Maybe it\\'s because it\\'s a first-time punishment, but it doesn\\'t smell and it\\'s cheap, but it\\'s delicious! I enjoyed the pork belly with vinegar! Doenjang-jjigae is good. Kimchi, chives, and pork belly are really good.  The price was cheap and everything on the menu was fine. I\\'m surprised that dessert ice cream is high quality like buying it.   I strongly recommend it from Konkuk University. The name of the store is kimchi chives pork belly, but the only delicious one is chives. Kimchi has the same taste as Chinese Kimchi and pork belly has a good rotation rate, but why is it so good? To the extent that I want to... It\\'s better not to eat the tteok-galbi that comes with it, and I ordered a set, spicy noodles, and an old lunch box, but I don\\'t like them all. Mushrooms were the best. The tables are narrow, but I kept going back and forth to put spoons and tissues.I went back and forth... and left behind my drink. I don\\'t like it. Basically, if it\\'s kimchi chives pork belly, these three things should be fine, but the pork belly was dry, so it wasn\\'t tasty, and it was so pickled that I couldn\\'t put on chopsticks that I couldn\\'t even put on it that I was breathless. I thought the sound of people working on the dishes and the sound of arranging the tray was really throwing it away. If there\\'s no music, I can fly this much, but the music is so loud that my head is ringing and there\\'s this sound...More. Meat fried rice was all delicious. The price is fine. There are a lot of things in a 2-person set, but everything is delicious except sausages. I feel like I\\'m running out of food, but I don\\'t regret going.. Facilities are good, unmanned, events are convenient, but there is no charger. I had a good time because the facilities are good. The service is good and the soundproof is good. It was clean, maybe because it was new. There is a spacious room, so I think it would be good to go with a large family or friends. I came in by chance, but it\\'s clean as if it\\'s a new place, and the facilities are nice.. Good~ 좋아요~. It\\'s normal.. Every time I come here, I drink either snowcano or snowcarpinut. It\\'s fucking delicious. I drank too often, and now I\\'m almost out of photos. If you have something to do with it, please come, shut up, and drink Snowcano. If I don\\'t know Cafe On, I won\\'t treat you like a city college student. It\\'s a lovely place. It\\'s a warm place to work. You\\'re also very sweet. Sandwiches, they\\'re all great! It\\'s too bad that we can meet the best bingsu next year. Good luck, Ms. Beautiful lady.Haha. nan. Five cartels of fun escaped with five minutes left. I really liked it because it was neat and I liked it more because it was kind!I had so much fun on the cloudy day of my last life.^^~ I\\'m going to try a cartel next time. I\\'ll trust you on the neck I graduated from my long-awaited journey. Cartels were a real hobby! Really active! I like the interior, too. I strongly recommend it. The cartel and cloudy days were so much fun! And the memory...Thriller? That\\'s too much.Congratulations on your graduation!. There is a senior citizen center next to it, and there is a pavilion next to it, and all the people who chat there are said to be building owners.. The boss was so kind and the staff kindly informed me, so I went there without knowing anything, but I made it pretty! The price was cheaper than other stores and the ring design was pretty and diverse, so it was hard to choose! A/S is always available, so make a pretty couple ring here.. I can\\'t set up the echo, I can\\'t turn the volume on the microphone, and I can\\'t find Echo, so I feel like I\\'m singing with the microphone on my bare neck. Never. It\\'s the best.. You did a great job on the flower path. Thank you for your effort.. Where in Jangchungdan Park is Cheonggyecheon Bridge? Have you been to the military or not? You look different in the picture. around 1965 in the army I love it. I love it. It\\'s the best. You can go on a warm day and draw some space to feel cool with a glass of beer! It is spring.. It\\'s the best.. I\\'m repairing the inside. I\\'ve never been there before, but it\\'s expensive, and there\\'s no answer. Land prices. Curtain, soundproof, sanitation. In conclusion, part-timers are unfriendly.The way the part-timer talks was a bit unkind. The ceiling was connected to the next room, so it was not soundproof at all, and the air conditioning was also air-conditioned and there was only a fan. It was hard to feel the comfort of the room cafe. The tall, bang-up part-timer is so unkind.I\\'m not going again. Here you go. I\\'ll press I strongly recommend this. When I was in Gwangju, I went there often and looked it up. As expected, it was okay. I often go to the academy with a friend who studies with me on weekdays. It\\'s good to study quietly and eat delicious food without being conscious of others I recommend it. It\\'s great. Why didn\\'t you know about it? I was sitting there paying you a lot of money. ~~~~ I\\'m going to roll around in the caramel now. I went there because it\\'s my friend\\'s birthday. She likes cute things. I didn\\'t know that other people were not aware of it. I just talked with my friends. I didn\\'t know that they were in Gangnam, but I liked them more because they I\\'m going to drop by on my next friend\\'s birthday. I went to the room cafe for the first time and I didn\\'t know what it was. My boyfriend found out so I went with him. It was really comfortable. I like drinking tea. So I drank a lot. I should go again. Gangnam Café Crane sounds good. I was shopping with my friend and I was so tired that I rolled around in the cafe crane. My legs hurt because of the heels, but I took a rest and went shopping again. I didn\\'t know it was warm and comfortable in Gangnam, but it\\'s so comfortable. I\\'m rolling around~ I\\'m at a cafe crane. I went there on weekends, but it was a whole new world when I went to cafes every day. Go to Gangnam station with your boyfriend and stop by when you\\'re tired. I often go to Gangnam station because of academy these days.I used the room cafe for the first time after reading the blog review.It\\'s a room cafe where you can watch TV. It\\'s amazing. There\\'s an unlimited refill of ice cream and waffles.Couples ^^. The worst of the facilities. . . . . . I felt a little awkward. The space is small, the locks are... The worst room escape experience. It\\'s the best.. I went to the stars\\' store ○ Why is it created? The screen input kept changing. (Average 7 times per song) I couldn\\'t memorize the lyrics, so I turned on the lyrics on my phone. ○○. It\\'s neat, but...It\\'s too expensive. The sudden change from four to two songs for 1,000 won.. Good. The best cartoon cafe I\\'ve ever been to.  There are so many books from old to very recent, and I get applications for all the books I want to read. And above all, it\\'s clean. The boss always sweeps and cleans, so there\\'s no dust and the bathroom is clean.  Coffee is also good to see because it uses Fritz coffee and even snacks and drinks are clean.. It rained so much that I ordered chicken pizza with my friends and went to play, and I was really satisfied.The biggest advantage of being able to take outside food! I liked it better because all the drinks were unlimited. The employees and the boss are so kind and the price is reasonable! Visit doctor 100! However, I hope you didn\\'t spray too much air freshener when cleaning up.. It\\'s the best.. I don\\'t know if it\\'s because there\\'s no bowling alley nearby, but the service mind... ...is again because there\\'s a lot of people in the inner bowling club, but it\\'s been two hours waiting so long. Since only experts go and kill, the sewage like me is always full in the evening and the evening when I come back. Nice place to play bowling! You can enjoy the view of Daum Soft\\'s Changdeok Palace on the rooftop. I recently went bowling with my family. / There were no seats available  It\\'s Saturday, and the boss isn\\'t very nice. And the Chinese restaurant right in front of us is closed. I don\\'t want to go back because I\\'m upset about this and that. There are a lot of other good places.. Okay.. a slightly ambiguous cafe. The highest price of sound in the surrounding coin singing rooms is 500 won, but there are two songs here. It\\'s the best.. He kindly taught me all the games because I only played games that I didn\\'t know how to play... The regular customers come often and it\\'s warm. You can enjoy board games, darts, drinks, and simple snacks!. The service is unkind and they don\\'t get what they ordered, they just smoke and stare at each other. The worst thing is that they smell like a dishcloth in a spoon and they don\\'t drink much, so I\\'ll bring it myself. It\\'s a waste of 10,000 won. Best. The employees were so kind and nice!! The quality of the room may be a little low, but it was fun enough. It\\'s a waste of nothing. The room preparation was not good, but the service was the worst. Okay.. Quiet, pretty, delicious coffee, Wi-Fi is good, and the desk and chair are comfortable. Reading a book in Mangwon-dong is the best. Quiet, affordable coffee Wi-Fi hot issue. Up to the latest issue!! There\\'s books in the basement. Peach. Lemonti is not... The 2nd floor is also private, with a reasonable price and a quiet atmosphere.. You know, this part-timer here isn\\'t so cheap.. The sound quality microphone and the boss often clean, so it\\'s very clean.. I thought the service would be the same as the Hue Cafe in Hongdae, but if the room is small and dirty, I called to ask if I could do Netflix, and I asked again, and they said I should enter my ID. I\\'m not going to go again. It feels like lying in the middle of a market canister! The room is not clean, so I go home and take a shower a hundred times! Do you really wash blankets and pillows, and it\\'s so narrow that you can\\'t even lay down! If two people go together, lie down in order! There is no variety of channels and movies to watch! Let\\'s have fun~~~~~~ Just this once! The facilities aren\\'t very clean. It was just cheap, so the TV was too high, so it was a little uncomfortable. If you lie down and watch TV, you\\'ll get a neck disc. Do you want to go there when you have a lot of time? full satisfaction. nan. It\\'s very expensive, and it\\'s not... The staff here are so kind and friendly that I went to drink coffee with a friend and came out. It\\'s the best. Coffee, song, mood, restaurant...☆. nan. It\\'s funny, but I give you 5 points because you have a low rating. 2 points are not for sure. About 3.5 to 4? I can\\'t see the hint that you managed the props roughly and I can\\'t even see if they\\'re props or not. The room escape by the lock for the lock is really... The more easily I solve the unconvincing problems, the more I\\'m disappointed, the more money I waste. Room escape is of high quality. This is one of the most sloppy places I\\'ve ever been to. It\\'s a totally improbable story. Okay.. Replay is not available in Hongdae during the evening and on weekends. There are so many people on the street that you can\\'t solve the problem right away even if it\\'s 80 minutes. I know Hong Dae-gil well, and I recommend a time zone where alarms are available because it is quiet. a room escape for the first time It was neat and the story seemed to have prepared a lot. In an hour! It\\'s refreshing that the story is connected. Its facilities are good and its contents are full. The best room escape cafe ever. The escape room cafe is so beautiful. It was fun.. (formerly)the place where Wauapart was. Wow. A good sports park near Sinchon, Sogang University, Hongdae. A good place to take a walk (exercise) in Hongdae.. The missions left by anonymous agents are hidden here and there. It must be done. (Gulgwi haha). The best. The best. The cats are so pretty that I keep thinking about them. They\\'re the best.. Okay.. Healing spot for lunchtime. Rabbits live, too.. nan. nan. nan. I\\'ve been worried because I couldn\\'t find it on the search list. It\\'s good to have a round-the-year-round Saturday and Sunday except for rainy December and January. The nearby Danghyeoncheon Stream is also close, so the Polly Playground is good next to it. Children\\'s rental fee is free and you can practice with your bike! It\\'s a bummer. Okay. I heard you\\'re going to Nowon Police Station on charges of assaulting Mr. Oh, who works at the bike rental center. ᄃᄃᄃ 책임져야 할 사람 좀 있겠군. Last year, it was better than any other franchise cartoon cafe. But it smells so bad and smells like a bathroom... Dusty hair on the floor... I don\\'t think I\\'m taking out any blankets. I can\\'t read books because of the smell... Please come back.It hasn\\'t been like that until last year, but I can smell it in the comic book cafe, and the bathroom has been for 500 fermented skate, and I can\\'t breathe and see what I need to do. As if the owner has changed, I promise I won\\'t go again after giving up my life. How can you not take care of yourself when you go to the bathroom? Do not use this during the morning hours of weekdays. The other staff is nice, but the female staff is really unkind.. Never take my ball. Floor finish not flat. No oil zone. I\\'ve never seen such an unmanaged bowling alley since 1999. It\\'s a waste of stars. It\\'s such a waste of stars. Short hair bob cut. The attitude of a female employee is so rude that it makes me feel terrible. You\\'re teaching them how to speak and behave, aren\\'t you? And it\\'s the worst thing about cutting up a horse when a customer says it. There is no oil on the rail or any oil on the ball. It\\'s a small lane, but it\\'s fine He\\'s.. I went to Seodaemun-gu because it was my first time. It\\'s a newly opened place, so it\\'s bright and clean and friendly.~~. I had so much fun! The side dishes are delicious, and there\\'s a lot to play with. I didn\\'t know time was passing!! I went on Instagram with a lot of publicity, and it was really nothing. Just four tents on the second floor...It would be more romantic to put a mini-tent in my room... ...because the menu is not particularly delicious, the cost-effective, or the atmosphere or concept is not unique. Boss, no way!. All kinds of books used to be tiger cigarettes are 90 percent and 10 percent new books are new, but new books are not released very quickly and there are not many books. First of all, it wasn\\'t clean and there were many foods that weren\\'t allowed. Thanks to a kind part-timer, I had a good time from the weekend morning.I often go to this place with my boyfriend. We eat and look around and there are many different kinds of books that we like. Actually, I go to see a comic book called Crayon Shinzzang, but it\\'s a place to heal me for a cup of ice amo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~? Personally, I think it\\'s the best forest to play with, so I often use it. Every time I go, I come out after a whole day.. It\\'s the best. I didn\\'t even hear the closing time when I went in, and I put in the money in advance, but a lady suddenly opened the door and told me to go out because it ended at 2:30. There\\'s no refund, there\\'s no refund, there\\'s no refund, there\\'s no refund, the system is like that, so the lights automatically turn off -- you didn\\'t even ask. I don\\'t know what to say even though it\\'s not thousands of won.. nan. Are you still open here?Mr. President of Hackpot Garbageim must have some money. Never go Especially, couples, never go. If you don\\'t want to go, don\\'t go.And the ice cream spoon there? I\\'m recycling disposable spoons. Look at the stars. Boss, no service mind. Unkindness. Go somewhere else.~~~~~~~ I feel bad. Worst of all, no alarm, you\\'re so annoying, there\\'s nothing to eat, there\\'s nothing to see, so I was going to pick it up and see, but that\\'s not it. I have to pay extra. The bathroom is separated by a man and a woman, but it\\'s open and it\\'s hard to lock. I just wanted to ask you, but you really don\\'t talk well. I don\\'t think you\\'re thinking about going to the D.O.A. again. Karaoke... It\\'s not a karaoke system, it\\'s a computer zilanet program. The quality and sound are terrible. I don\\'t know if it\\'s like this elsewhere because wii hasn\\'t done it elsewhere, but it\\'s completely illuminated in the karaoke room;. Two thousand wons and very good facilities.. 젛 Many menus are not closed; it\\'s in A-dong, so check carefully, it\\'s closed.. nan. There are many things to play besides bowling and the bowling alley facilities are neat and nice. When you pay for bottled beer here, look at the menu in advance and make a calculation and make sure to match. I paid for a 25,000 won card for three bottles of beer, but I checked the menu later and it was 20,000 won worth...  It\\'s been a while, and I don\\'t have a receipt.  If the customer feels like he\\'s drunk, he\\'s either ripped off, or the counter part-timer just comes out thinking he\\'s not good enough to pay. I went to play with my friends and I liked it because it was very clean and well-equipped.I just have a lot of customers, so it would be better to call in advance.*^^*~~. It\\'s cheap, clean, and nice. I always go here.. It\\'s so nice.. I\\'m repairing the inside. I\\'ve never been there before, but it\\'s expensive, and there\\'s no answer. Land prices. Curtain, soundproof, sanitation. In conclusion, part-timers are unfriendly.The way the part-timer talks was a bit unkind.

It\\'s the best board game cafe near Hankuk University of Foreign Studies! There are many board games and the atmosphere is good. Star in my heart... I don\\'t like it.. Okay, Joa-yong, I don\\'t like it.. First of all, the female counter staff is so unfriendly and she gets caught twice, and every time she protests, she scolds her eyes and says something. I felt really bad. I wish there was another bowling alley in this town. There\\'s only this place, so people are flocking here. Do you really hate to pay for the quality of the wait for more than an hour of waiting? The female counter staff was very unfriendly and there were a few broken balls. And there was a phenomenon where bowling pins were not able to fall over alone due to machine errors, but the score was added. My team is really bad at bowling, so they\\'re getting angry because I\\'m getting caught on the rails. I\\'ve been here a lot so far, and my parents are asking me to pay 50 million won for my team member.  Who do you think you\\'re a fool? You\\'re such a junkie here that you want to make personal attacks on female employees.                                 It\\'s annoying to see the female staff frowning every time they come to the bowling alley on a regular basis. They\\'re coming every two weeks. Do you think we\\'re making a big fuss? I\\'m telling you, if you don\\'t hire two of your staff, you\\'re doomed. I want to give you a zero rating.Folding. Can\\'t you lower than 2 points? The service is terrible.I rolled it once or twice to see if you didn\\'t clean the lane, and your hands were black and some balls were broken, but you don\\'t seem to be taking care of them.The facilities are completely old-fashioned. They\\'re sunny.I love you, pretty girl.. We do not update new cartoons after the April 28, 2015 update because. nan. Exercise + walking. The weather is so nice these days.. The boss is kind. I got candy for White Day.LOL. It\\'s really good to do 24 hours for two 500 won songs!. I think it\\'s the best place around Wolgok Station. The facilities are clean, the sound quality of the microphone is good, and above all, the lady is very kind. I went alone at night, but without saying anything, please add a song and welcome me with a smile!. It\\'s quiet and cozy!!! It\\'s the best.. I don\\'t know if it\\'s near the office, but I don\\'t have one more song for 1,000 won...ᅲ. The cost-effectiveness of room escape is overwhelming!! The staff members are kind and have a lot of equipment~ We had a lot of fun.I\\'ve done room escape about 60 times and this place is the best! It\\'s the best. I came after Saw, but since it\\'s a room with a lot of devices, I think the escape room is a device room. LOL. The 2nd store will be easy for beginners. The staff is kind.. I don\\'t know why you\\'re talking to a customer like that. He gave me a rough explanation of the hints, so I\\'ve been asking all the time... They\\'re all locks. Unkindness. Kingsman is fun.. The bowling alley facilities are very nice because they can be clean and clean.  But there seems to be more and more restrictions on free time use.  When I first used it, I could comfortably use the lane alone even if I met someone I knew, so I could do it in proportion to the time, but today I went to use the Hura Free Time and they restricted me from using the rain.  Of the 16 lanes, there were more than 10 lanes left.  So I went to enjoy myself.The facilities are good.. It\\'s not a room cafe, it\\'s a real book cafe!. The place is wide and it is good to play games with many people. But the elevator was very uncomfortable.. nan. It\\'s the best.. Oh, part-timer, you\\'re so unkind. No other branches are like this, but don\\'t expect service. The employees are so unfriendly. Do the theme of the second store...It\\'s also here in Hongik University or Bupyeong, so if possible, I recommend another branch. Is Alcatraz a lot of fun? I really enjoyed it with my friends! Perfect theme, perfect fun, perfect. That\\'s enough I\\'ve been to five or six room escape rooms so far, and there were many of the freshest ones. Five points are given to new, amazing and novel elements rather than difficult puzzles or probabilities.. The atmosphere is good. It\\'s because it\\'s expensive.. It\\'s the best.. Everything\\'s good.. I saw the event outside, and it was already over, and I was very unfriendly whether it was a part-time job or a boss, and they gave me feedback and asked me to check out? Please close the door. The microphone is loud and loud. I like the room more than anything! If it\\'s too small, it\\'s like an arcade or a karaoke room, so it\\'s stuffy. It\\'s big here, so I\\'m choking. On the TJ machine. Except for the lack of soundproofing, the facilities are good and the three of us can play well in one room. He was a male employee, and he was kind. Whether it\\'s an employee or a CEO, it\\'s really unkind and the facilities are not as clean as they are a chain store. Maybe it\\'s because it\\'s underground.I think we\\'d better use another place.. Located on B2 of Gunyoung Omni Department Store, there are 12 to 14 lanes. The facilities are a bit outdated and there are a lot of machine errors, but they\\'re pretty good to use. As far as I know, there is only a place near Gongneung Station in Nowon. My friend and I are going to go.. Black Pearl Gaenojam... a sublime work that discredits the reputation of Keiscape The staff are not kind. I felt like I was bothered by the guest. The room escape dwarf theme was fun. Okay.. Kind and nice, not very cool, but just for a rest. I don\\'t feel very comfortable. Sometimes it fits me perfectly and sometimes it doesn\\'t. There\\'s no evidence of plastic cups being reused, so the cup crumpled up and the sense of coming out... The boss is kind. Good and kind because it\\'s not too crowded. It was nice of you to be kind and cool off the massage machine.Yo~. Three thousand won songs. It\\'s a bit crowded. The space was too small for three people to share. It\\'s clean. You\\'re the best!. A good place to sit in a cafe and read comic books!. He\\'s got a good mind. It looks like a new one, but it\\'s nice and nice compared to a nearby bowling alley.. Club music keeps playing, so it\\'s a bit noisy. If you have weak hearing, be careful. Good. It\\'s freezing! Not a single star is a waste. The customer has to watch the boss and play the game. You\\'d rather go to Samsung Sports nearby.. I went with my friends and we had a lot of fun together. Shinchon\\'s Best Room Escape Cafe!. nan. I\\'m a bowling genius. Your mind is rotten. I think it\\'s the buzzword for this bowling alley to go to another bowling alley. The worst bowling alley I\\'ve ever been to. It\\'s not a pre-payment system or a limit on the number of games, but a female part-timer comes to the table and asks how many games she\\'s going to play if there are more customers. I\\'m protesting, so the guy who\\'s telling me to go to the other bowling alley. It\\'s nice and friendly.^^. I just came back from the bowling alley, which is small but kind and comfortable.. All the themes are so funny. I wanted to do it all of a sudden, so I was looking for a nearby place, but I didn\\'t have a review here, so I didn\\'t expect it, but the quality was good. Recommendation!!. It\\'s the best.. Rental shoes and arrange bowling balls. It\\'s neat, exciting and fun. I\\'m fine on weekends except for expensive ones.. It\\'s good for beginners because it\\'s unlimited. And neat and friendly staff. Funny and well-organized. Discounts on revisiting photos. I\\'m so happy that the karaoke machine.. Five acoustics for 1,000 won is also good.. It\\'s my first time using it, but you\\'re very kind and nice.Overall, the facilities are clean, so it\\'s good.I laughed so hard with my wife.It\\'s my first time going to an escape room cafe. Time flies so fast. It seems like a good dating course! I sometimes go to a room escape cafe with my girlfriend, and I think the facilities here are the cleanest and best. Room escape is always new and fun. I went there with my friends, and there are a lot of fresh horses maybe because it\\'s newly opened. It\\'s fun! I strongly recommend!. I\\'ve been to other places, but I liked it because there were many themes! I thought it would be unreasonable because there were many themes, but it was more fun than expected and the staff was nice. I was so happy that the people working were so kind! The facilities were clean and I was frustrated at first because I was wearing a mask, but I forgot to wear a mask later on. LOL It\\'s so much fun.It\\'s very well-organized and I\\'ve been to Hongdae, and there are many room escape cafes that don\\'t clean up. The Maze was clean.It\\'s a good place to hang out with your boyfriend because it\\'s cold these days and there is nothing to do outside.~~bb :^). It was cold, so I had no worries. It was fun. It was good! When it\\'s hot and you don\\'t deserve it, you should definitely go!. It\\'s been remodeled a while ago, and it\\'s very neat, but honestly, the rain is a rolling stock.However, I like the shop because it is very kind and has good workmanship.. It\\'s good to go on a weekday evening or when I\\'m not busy. I often come to Shin Kwon Do, and the Jjapaghetti that the boss or part-timer makes is delicious.No, I use it often, but... Well, I\\'m sure you don\\'t look so good. There are two men who chatter like a coffee shop in a cartoon cafe for an hour. How can you not stop me? I\\'ll go to a coffee shop. Two guys have been talking about interviews all day. They\\'re doing it because they don\\'t know they\\'re being mean. I\\'m here to read comic books. I don\\'t know why I have to listen to their interview TMI. I\\'m sure you\\'ll find a good job. You don\\'t even know basic etiquette.Folding. Let\\'s go often. It\\'s the largest near my house and I\\'m constantly bringing in new books. The taste of the drink is good, but the unkindness that devalues all services is the best. First of all, don\\'t laughI\\'m telling you to tell me before you take off your shoes, tell me to take off my shoes, and I\\'m telling you to take off your shoes. If you stay there for a long time, you\\'ll be able to respond to the customer response manual... ..see. It\\'s good to go when there\\'s no one around. First of all, unkindness.. I felt bad looking at the attitude of the boss\\'s service. The president or the male employee is very unfriendly. I don\\'t think I\\'ll come back because I\\'m upset. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Comics are also cheap. And the boss is so kind! It is perfect for a summer date!. It\\'s the best.. First of all, he\\'s so kind. He\\'s so nice and cool. We went to the air conditioner room with our family, and it\\'s too much for each person.5,000 won per game and 2,500 won for shoes. The facilities are great and the staff is so kind!^^. Compared to very unfriendly facilities, beef. Sinchon Rock Bowling Stadium. It\\'s a bowling pub.* It was fun enjoying beer and exercising with friends! It\\'s convenient to visit because it\\'s near Sinchon.. I think I went to Japan for a short time. It\\'s a small prop and I remember the owner\\'s dessert skills.. It\\'s the best.. There\\'s such a large park near your neighborhood that you can heal your tired, boring routine. It\\'s great for children to run around and take a walk around dogs or jogs because it\\'s great. It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. once my playground The fields on the first and second courses of Gangseo Dulle-gil, Nalmeori. Let\\'s finish in the middle as of April 2016 for a solid coin singing room.. nan. It\\'s a good rest area.. I went to the weekend opening, and I went to the 10:30 p.m. opening, and there were no employees and the staff who came out were very unfriendly, so I felt bad. You\\'re so blunt that I thought I did something wrong. The boss is kind. All right. Complain response is slow. employees are rude. nan. I\\'ve been there so many times, but I can see that it\\'s getting more and more unmanageable....Don\\'t order Nolmuk Tteokbokki anywhere because it\\'s no good, especially cream Tteokbokki is really bad objectively. The attic downstairs is all cobwebs, so I sat in an open space, and the spiders crawling next to me...It\\'s not like I haven\\'t cleaned for a day or two, but the cushion cushion is full of smell. There are a lot of books and the staff is kind.It\\'s good to go in and rest when it\\'s hot! I went at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, but it\\'s not open. Please modify the open time information. I like the facilities and comic books, but I don\\'t want to come again because of the part-timer. When I asked the part-timer what he asked, he didn\\'t answer, and I asked him again, and he said, \"I didn\\'t feel good about it.\" Okay, it\\'s normal. Oh, that\\'s great! There are a lot of the same play forest, but it\\'s an incomparable class. Sinchon nori was not popular in Facebook for no reason...!! It seems that the Ewha Womans University branch was small and unfriendly...I\\'m touched!. It\\'s the best. Good window seat.. Hahahahaha, the review staff is awesome or did you pay for marketing money? Personally, I\\'m fine. I. If you look at all the reviews written on June 27th, you\\'ll get the answer, right? I visit bowling alley once or twice a week. Employees who are always kind to me~ Bowling skills are not good enough. 덕ᄏ Thanks to the sales director\\'s teaching, I am steadily getting more than 200 points. The lesson fee is always a cup of coffee...It\\'s perfect for learning bowling.I strongly recommend you!!! The counter is pretty and all the staff are kind and I think it\\'s really nice. I played rock-ball with my coworkers at the company dinner and they really liked it. It\\'s great to think of going there often. I started off pleasantly because the counter is pretty and kind, but I\\'m satisfied that the staff members of the party listen to me without showing any signs of being asked to do I don\\'t understand why you want me to play with strangers when it\\'s daytime.ᅮ.ᅮ. This room is perfect for sexual behavior. Always use it well! I don\\'t want to... There are not many kinds of comic books... I don\\'t like it.. I don\\'t like it.. The facilities are good and the rain maintenance oil zone dry zone is good. I don\\'t know if it\\'s outsourced, but it doesn\\'t recover quickly even though several lanes are broken. It\\'s all good, but every time I go bowling, I don\\'t know if it\\'s a mechanical failure or something, and there\\'s a few missing bowling pins, and it happens every time... Good!!! Have fun every time you go. Good. Good 1. Bowling, archery, arcade (basketball), beer, etc. are all there is, and it is not even crowded. It\\'s clean and so nice!! I strongly recommend! I want to go every day.I went with my girlfriend and she loved it. I think it\\'s really the best dating course...!! Especially archery is a divine move! It was so much fun.I\\'m going to go there again next weekend! It\\'s hot! Hot! Hot  The bowling alley is really big and board games are free when you wait. And darts.  Archery! Real archery...  Times Square became more interesting. I like archery, bowling, and billiards. I think it\\'s very good to use as a group. I\\'ll use it often. It\\'s a surprise place. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Archery, bowling, billiards, etc. Stress relief! I\\'ll go again next time.  It\\'s so fun and surprising. Here\\'s the new world. Bowling, billiards, and unfamiliar archery.~~~~~ I didn\\'t play well because of the appointment time, but I have to go again.~There are so many things I couldn\\'t do.I can\\'t believe there was a place like this in Times Square in Seoul! There are a lot of things to play such as bowling alley, archery, and pocket ball. I had a great time on a date because I didn\\'t have to go anywhere to enjoy it in one day.^^. The weather is hot outside these days, so I went shopping at Times Square and a new bowling alley opened. I like bowling so much and the facilities are clean, so I played it. The staff was nice, the facilities were very clean and nice. As expected, Seoul is good. ^^* I lost all my stress and had a lot of fun.  I think it\\'s a must at least once. I\\'ll have to go again. I had an appointment at Yeongdeungpo Station, and I stopped by Palm Square and went up to the bowling alley. It wasn\\'t the bowling alley that I thought of until now, but it was a place where I could enjoy various sports on a date, so I was surprised and I wanted to have this kind of facility in my neighborhood. I\\'d like to use it more often.^^. The bowling alley is clean and spacious, and I feel good because I\\'m good at playing games~~~~ There\\'s an archery field that I\\'ve only seen on TV, and it\\'s amazing and fun doing it for the first time. I\\'m so happy to have a bowling alley in Times Square.   I\\'m going to play games with my friends. Next time, I\\'m going to hit strikes twice in a row. It\\'s not easy.**. The bowling alley is really big and it\\'s a facility that\\'s tailored to the modern era. Also, billiard rooms are very neat. It\\'s so pleasant because it doesn\\'t smell like cigarettes. Archery was an event I\\'ve never experienced before, but it\\'s hard to experience it myself, but it\\'s so much fun and I want to continue. I love the part where I can enjoy sports because there are lots of drinks and things to eat. I\\'d love to come with my family. I went to see a movie and went up to a new bowling alley, and the facilities are wide and clean and nice.  There were a lot of people, so we had archery and billiard rooms together, so we could spend time doing other things. There were free pocket balls and board games, so I don\\'t think there was any inconvenience to use. I strongly recommend it as a dating course! I happened to go to Times Square and had a lot of fun. I went shopping, bowling, and archery. Archery is really good. I feel like a player. Everything about sports, all at once, but there\\'s such a wonderful place in the shopping center. This place is so convenient to use and you can wait to meet your friends. I highly recommend those who have enough time!!! I didn\\'t know there would be a place like this in Yeongdeungpo\\'s best shopping center.It\\'s very clean and nice.Archery is so fun and similar to the actual feeling of archery... I will use it often from now on. I think it\\'s so nice to hang out with friends and lovers all!  At first, I thought the bowling alley was a little small, but there\\'s a big one inside. There\\'s an archery field, billiard room, darts, board games, and so many things to enjoy.^^ There were so many people so we had some waiting time, but the staff were so kind that we could comfortably wait.  I really recommend it!!! I strongly recommend it as a dating course! I stopped by once because the waiting time for the movie was long, and the atmosphere is crazy!!  Unlike the existing bowling alley, there are three sections, so each feels different.  Maybe because of the atmosphere, I also recorded the best record;; especially archery, which is difficult for beginners to encounter, was taught by the staff and experienced something different. The counter is pretty and all the staff are kind and I think it\\'s really nice.  I went there with my friends and it was really wide and clean. For your information, it was my first time playing archery and I didn\\'t know it was this fun. There was nothing else to do except shopping at Times Square. I\\'m so happy to have a place where I can enjoy many things at once. There\\'s a lot to eat, clean, and I enjoyed it so much.  I\\'ll use it often!   I was dragged to the shopping hell by my girlfriend, and I was so bored that I went once...  Oh, this is more than I expected! I used to like bowling, but I don\\'t know how fun archery is.So much fun~! I was going to buy dinner because of darts, but I lost. Anyway, I want to stop by Times Square again.~~~Revenge war! haha. I think it\\'s so nice to hang out with friends and lovers all!  At first, I thought the bowling alley was a little small, but there\\'s a big one inside. There\\'s an archery field, billiard room, darts, board games, and so many things to enjoy.^^ There were so many people so we had some waiting time, but the staff were so kind that we could comfortably wait.

I used to like bowling, but I don\\'t know how fun archery is.So much fun~! I was going to buy dinner because of darts, but I lost. Anyway, I want to stop by Times Square again.I went shopping and just went bowling. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! There\\'s an archery field. I\\'ve been wanting to do it for a long time, but I shot 10 times. I accidentally put a bullet in 10 points.I think I\\'ll be looking for you more often. The facilities are so nice as they are newly opened. I strongly recommend group club meetings.^^. I love it because it\\'s neat, spacious and clean!. The facilities are really good!!!!!. Okay.. It\\'s the best.. The boss was kind and had fun with the house and Psycho. The price is also the best! It\\'s a waste of a star. If the story (The Prison) is too unlikely and the staff (the old man) is too unfriendly; if you answer it like it\\'s annoying and stuffy and go get some service training... All the worst story problems are rubbish and the service is terrible. Employees are unkind and upset, and there are six locks in one room. I gave you five points because you were so kind. I think the location should be seen as Children\\'s Grand Park rather than Konkuk University, but the price is much lower than other stores. The level is higher than other places.Neyong. I don\\'t recommend Swinggate. It\\'s not fun to move rooms. The employee doesn\\'t seem willing to work. I don\\'t mean it.. It\\'s the best.. Sound sounds better than good. The sound of breathing is so loud in the microphone itself that those who sing well will be embarrassed because the sound is too loud. In other words, there is no sound of raw things, but an MSG sound comes out, which is reflected to those who want to go practice singing. But it\\'s neat and well-equipped, so most people will be satisfied if they go. We can\\'t refute the best sound and facilities in this area. The boss is kind and hygiene control is good.. The two-track facility is not bad for 1,000 won, but I think it\\'s in this price range because it\\'s only here.. nan. It\\'s good to take a walk with your dog.. nan. It\\'s nice because it\\'s clean and cozy. Wow, I wish there was a cartoon cafe in my neighborhood.First of all, it\\'s spacious and neat. Americano is so delicious. I think I\\'ll go often. It\\'s neat and the drink is very delicious.~~. It\\'s clean and comfortable. And the service is the best~~ He\\'s very kind and clean.. There are a lot of board games and they\\'re. I think it\\'s the best board game cafe I\\'ve ever been to. I went to both the first and second Superboard stores in time for the opening on February 16th, but the doors were closed and I went elsewhere. It\\'s normal. It\\'s. It\\'s good because there are many games. But I\\'m leaving the window of the store open, and there\\'s too much cigarette smell coming from outside (to the point where my head hurts...) If you don\\'t like the smell of cigarettes, go to the inner seat~^^ If the air purifier is a bit full, you can give me the highest score.. I was reading comic books at the table because the waiting time was getting longer and they gave me snacks for free!Thank you for your kindness.. Maybe because it hasn\\'t been long since it was created, it\\'s neat and the staff is kind. I\\'ve been using it these days. Two for 500 won and four for 1,000 won.. a simple and comfortable place. It\\'s the best. There\\'s a regular bowling alley on the 3rd floor and a rock bowling alley on the 4th floor.  The facilities are spacious.. It\\'s good to chat because it\\'s quiet even though it\\'s Gangnam. A quiet, studyable, distinctive cafe. Okay, it\\'s normal. The atmosphere is good, even though it is Gangnam on the weekend, it is very quiet.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. The interior was great and it was so much fun!. nan. There are not many types of room escape.ᅲ. Never go, Mike. Trash ○ I couldn\\'t hear you 20 years ago. The sound quality of the wired microphone was so bad that it was almost called raw wood. I don\\'t like the sound It\\'s not wide, so I\\'m happy to be alone! It\\'s comfortable, but at night, there are many people and restaurants nearby, so it feels a little dangerous. Go during the day~!. If it was close to my house, I would like to go to a ramen restaurant every day. The facilities and toilets are clean and nice. I\\'d like to give you a rating of 5.5 if you feel like it. I want to come every day. Ramen restaurants will be open!!!  There\\'s also a dog cat. It\\'s too much. My favorite place is also a dog cat, so it follows people well and plays well. I like it because there are the most comic book types among comic cafes around here. I want to buy a regular ticket.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s clean and nice.. As a room escape lover, flat themes (two stars) and stores (three stars) that are satisfied with the service. The escape room itself is full of stories, interiors, and quizzes. But all the people who work are so rude and unkind that they won\\'t come back again. It\\'s normal.. I know you don\\'t have much to do with Mr. Baldame, but don\\'t expect an active response when something happens.. The part-timer\\'s knowledge of comic books is zero. From his irritating speech to his facial expression, if you want to visit him, please go to a different place. The facilities are just as good as other locations, and they\\'re not bad. Except the staff isn\\'t very kind. Good. It\\'s quiet because there are not many people, so it\\'s good to read or study.. It\\'s a lot shorter than the rail ride bowling. If you come here, you\\'ll be three-step. The ball spin doesn\\'t work well either. It\\'s neat and pretty and has nail clippers, but it\\'s a bit expensive. I don\\'t like it.. The staff is kind. I recommend Hyehwa General Store. It\\'s fun. It\\'s a success, but I\\'ve been to a lot of places where I\\'ve been completely disappointed by the unkindness of the staff, but I feel like I\\'ve succeeded for the first time and succeeded. The conclusion is that I don\\'t feel. I used to drink a room escape cafe, and the room was so spacious and the air was so fresh that it was very nice. There were a lot of machines without the connection to the story, but Keystake was going on, so...There was no connection like this, right? It was really fun, and the interior was so well-made that the immersion was no joke!!! I strongly recommend this!. It\\'s the best.. Good. It\\'s the first time I\\'ve never been to a board game where I don\\'t explain the game because I\\'m busy. I visited on Sunday morning. It\\'s my first time at a comic book cafe, and it\\'s neat and kind and the food is delicious. I only did it for 2 hours, but I was there for 5 hours. It seems a little expensive, but it\\'s a good place for family. Next time, with my son. I visited for the first time after searching the internet. They gave me jelly service. It was a shame that I missed the event period, but it was clean and quiet because people didn\\'t know it yet. Time is a little more expensive than anywhere else.. I took a good rest. You can play games if you have a lot of things to play, and there are general books, and the seats are wide and fun! I\\'m going to try some food next time. It\\'s the best. It\\'s not in every book I\\'m looking for. A kind, neat, cozy, and nice comic cafe.  I don\\'t care where you sit, how you sit, or how long you sit.  Rabokki is good, too.. Is the boss crazy? I\\'m not giving it to you because it\\'s pretty. Don\\'t get me wrong. Don\\'t look at me like that when you go out. You\\'ll be on the screen. I can\\'t go because it\\'s so dirty. I was so scared that I came out in the middle.  You dirty-looking boss, reflect on yourself. Why would a woman come to a karaoke room? There is a magical place where there are 4 songs for 1,000 won and 1 song for 500 won. In the room, there are mic shells and trash on the table to see if you don\\'t clean. He doesn\\'t care if part-timers come in or out. Four songs are cheap, and the sound system is good. If you put 3,000 won on weekdays, they\\'ll give you three more. 3 songs for 1,000 won! If you go during your free time, you get 5 songs for 1,000 won.. I recommend a really interesting and exotic experience.. I don\\'t like it.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best.. Okay.. I hope you clean up the most secluded and quiet forest I\\'ve ever been to. I hope you will continue to do I\\'m sorry, but do you call this food? I can\\'t match the amount of water I drink. It tastes like chocolate banana water. Dinner\\'s salty, stinky, and it\\'s such a waste of money. Do you hire any part-timers? I just wanted to end it by telling him not to come back, but that\\'s so mean. I don\\'t really have any comic books. I don\\'t even know how to organize books that are cheap at secondhand bookstores. It\\'s not just the books, it\\'s the places where people sit. I asked for a clean-up, and I came with a frown on my face, so I just gave you a blanket. I think I used to drink alcohol at least in other forests and push my hair with a twirl. Okay, comic books are really small, with my brother.. The facilities are pretty poor. Okay, I think it\\'s the only coin karaoke in Mangwon. I\\'ve been to a private room twice. It\\'s a little hard to sing because the sound is reflected. I haven\\'t been to the big room. It\\'ll be better.. nan. It\\'s five rails, and it\\'s expensive, and I don\\'t know why... The rails are terrible. It\\'s good to play regardless of the score. The atmosphere is good, but the rain is so bad that if you don\\'t think about the score, it\\'s a good place to have fun. Lane\\'s been in trouble all the time, but it\\'s good for a lot of people to play with. The service is good, but the management is poor.. nan. It\\'s nice because the facilities! The boss is kind and the books are clean.. It\\'s good for beginners because it\\'s unlimited. And neat and friendly staff. Funny and well-organized. Discounts on revisiting photos. The best facilities! The part-time job is really unkind. Be careful if you don\\'t want to offend before singing. Alba is very unfriendly.. nan. It\\'s like playing with little kids, just going to see them go, not really a rock bowling alley, not an official bowling alley. It\\'s a bowling alley. It\\'s a waste of money.. It\\'s a waste of a point. Really, I don\\'t take care of rain, I don\\'t take care of my cheeks, I don\\'t care about my part-time job. Don\\'t go because the lane is short and the seats are cramped. The staff is so kind. We have to go as a group, but we can\\'t make a reservation. They told us by phone when we get a seat, so we could play right away. It\\'s the best~! The rail is not bad~! The staff is kind and the rails are short, so it\\'s nice to have it for beginners.But the last time I went there, there was a mechanical error on the 6th rail, so all the pins were down and the scoreboard was all messed up. Please refer to it if you\\'re going to go. It was the worst bowling alley ever. If you\\'re going to go bowling, gg, if you\\'re going to go for a drink, you\\'re free to go. If you take my ball, you\\'ll be careful. The rain condition will be 1 out of 10 and the picture light will be meaningless. Rock bowling alley is exciting. There\\'s also a variety of entertainment machines. It\\'s a nice club atmosphere..  ·. I\\'ve been there twice. It\\'s the worst. When I first went there, I paid 5,000 won and I was going to sing. I only had one of two wireless microphones, so I couldn\\'t even sing it with my friend. And the second time, was it room 3? Anyway, while I was singing in that room, the music changed and stopped playing. I sang 10 songs to see if someone else was adjusting another room or not managing the machine, but 2 songs were sung in the first verse, I was going to sing the highlight part, and 3 songs changed by myself, so I got annoyed.;; Fold as if you are not managing. Think about your personality first before cursing the long-haired employee. False advertisement. Bowling shop long-haired employee. Unkind and unkempt and bad at bowling. I saw a blog ad here, and the part-timers are so unfriendly and I\\'m not going back -- I\\'m not going. A bowling alley where experience teams are mobilized to promote their blogs! Service is the worst!! Don\\'t trust your blog reviews............ 1.Too few event games compared to the batting average. 2.No dressing room. 3. Oil before 3 games is dry. I\\'m sorry that the staff is not friendly.LOL. cozy and good. There are so many songs that don\\'t exist. Especially, it\\'s not easy to upload a new song and the microphone or remote control button is missing. How many songs are there for 1,000 won?. I left Tupinger\\'s ball to the ground, but he pretended to be generous and said he would give me 60,000 won, which is normally 70,000 won. There was some unkindness when there was no seat on the phone, but it was a place I used to visit often because it was close, and since then I never went there with my friends... It\\'s a shame that there are no seats because the bowling alley staff who are kind to the students are so popular. The bowling lane and the price range employees go for a few thousand won more, and it\\'s a joke, ○○. You\\'re a jerk. Gongneung-dong Bowling Ground. It\\'s fun! The boss is kind, too. The room theme is all fun. I enjoyed playing games with my boyfriend after a long time. Room Escape on the New Flower Road in Gangnam. It was convenient to put bills directly into the machine without exchanging coins outside. It\\'s the best. It\\'s clean and nice. Nice and nice. Microphone speaker store is the best! Let\\'s go to Lee Dong-ne only for Seven Star~ During the day, it\\'s really cheap for four songs. I often go to play around, but I didn\\'t like this place.. Two songs for 1,000 won, but it is neat and each room has an air conditioner.. Nan. Wind wish~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Nan. Han River. I thought I\\'d get some digestion, but... It\\'s freezing.. It\\'s the first time I\\'ve never been to a board game where I don\\'t explain the game because I\\'m busy. I visited on Sunday morning. It\\'s my first time at a comic book cafe, and it\\'s neat and kind and the food is delicious. I only did it for 2 hours, but I was there for 5 hours. It seems a little expensive, but it\\'s a good place for family. Next time, with my son. I visited for the first time after searching the internet. They gave me jelly service. It was a shame that I missed the event period, but it was clean and quiet because people didn\\'t know it yet. Time is a little more expensive than anywhere else.. It was a room cafe, but I couldn\\'t find anything different from a regular cafe.. The food is delicious and there are lots of seats. There is an arcade and board game is fun. I go often.I hope it stays for a long time. It\\'s just a clean cafe concept. I don\\'t have enough books for cartoon enthusiasts. There are many cartoons that do not increase the number of books rather than bunk beds. Board games, oric rooms, and comic books. Nacho and Doncas are so delicious!!. I\\'ll be there around 12:00 and get 30 minutes of service, and the microphone will snap and the button won\\'t work.The facilities are not very good, but I was tricked by the review of two thousand won songs.. Two rooms a day. One was so fun. One was so scary. I\\'d like to. There was a reason why I told you not to go... It\\'s a cheap facility. It\\'s a \\'90s facility.Don\\'t go. Please don\\'t go. Even if we are unfriendly, we are so unfriendly, and we played two rounds and it was over 50,000 won. After seeing the negative reviews, I\\'m going to play bowling, but I didn\\'t expect a huge service, so I went there, but it\\'s really bulky and bad. Don\\'t go. The worst garbage bowling alley ever. It\\'s dirty and has a lot of scratches on its cheeks, and the rail is also nuclear waste level. The boss talks to the customer like a servant. I\\'ve never seen such a rude boss in bowling alley. I can\\'t leave my score on NAVER, but if I could leave it, it would be 0... It\\'s old and not neat. I\\'m a little sad. 2013.07.10 Wenren won two consecutive games with Yun Bang, the third highlight bowling alley! See you next time at Donnie Burger\\'s bunker. Bowling in a long time, my ball is always on the garter... boasting a very expensive game cost of nearly 7,000 won per game and really doesn\\'t grease the rain. So I complained about it, but they said they\\'ll do well in the rain next time, but they said they\\'ll do the same as before anyway if they do it again. And without saying sorry, he ignores and makes sarcastic remarks that he is a student. I thought it was 4,300 won, but 7,500 won...Two of you played three games and paid 50,000 won. The ohm rail condition was so bad and short and crazy. It was so expensive and the rail was short and weird...I saw the blog, and it wasn\\'t that price; I could play another game with that money, which was a shame.Two people went on Monday afternoon, and each game was 13,000 won............ Do you repair the rail?ᄏWhy is the rail in this shape? I\\'m afraid of star-spangled prayers. I\\'ve got a lot of bruises on my cheeks, I\\'ve got a bad rail, and I\\'ve got to pay for the conversation, Gambi Davisam. the worst bowling alley Thiefful danger. `. The part-timer is too loud. Isn\\'t the comic book cafe a bit quiet? Because of that, it was noisy for everyone else to read the comic book. Please refer to it. The cat is calm and cozy. Caramel macchiato is too bad. If there are more webtoon comic books, hehehe. There are lots of coffee sheep and cats are so pretty. Cute cats roam around...! With five cats. A good place to watch cartoons.. Narrow and too open for other places. The president\\'s unfriendly response to customers makes me feel bad. I thought it was just me, but a lot of people have already written it. unfriendly. The president\\'s insincere reception. Facilities and books are fine, but the boss is very unfriendly. He smiled and said hello or ordered, but he didn\\'t answer properly, and his face looked sour and his tone was also a quarrel. I don\\'t know if you\\'re interested in doing business. I will never visit again because of my boss.. Mikey\\'s ears are cracking, so I haven\\'t been looking for a long time to change rooms, so I don\\'t have time, and I\\'m just annoyed, but you should be at the counter.. It\\'s the best.. ○○○○. The lock was unlocked by an employee\\'s mistake, so we couldn\\'t proceed anymore. It\\'s a human job, so I\\'ll try to understand the mistake, but since then, the staff and the boss have been in such a mess that I don\\'t want to visit again. I really don\\'t know why I\\'m here. It\\'s so much fun. Compared to other places, I think we made a good theme room. I was embarrassed because my friends screamed that it was amazing. I should try the horror room next time. It\\'s fun. I\\'ve tried the secret room and it\\'s done well. I was satisfied overall except for the small waiting area.. nan. It\\'s the best. I have an iPad skin store.. Neat and comfortable seats, drinks and dishes are all delicious~! It\\'s neat and nice.. Guys, don\\'t go here. I have to go. It\\'s a new building, it\\'s clean, it\\'s all good, but I\\'m not satisfied with the grease (exactly speaking, it\\'s a different pattern from other bowling alley). There was no oil on either end of the lane, so I rolled the ball in a different route than usual... Well, it was fun to find a way to attack...ᅲᅮᅮ. nan. There\\'s such a large park near your neighborhood that you can heal your tired, boring routine. It\\'s great for children to run around and take a walk around dogs or jogs because it\\'s great. It\\'s the best. It\\'s normal. once my playground The fields on the first and second courses of Gangseo Dulle-gil, Nalmeori. I\\'ve been there twice, but it\\'s unkind and I don\\' Good. The place I visited for a cup of coffee, it\\'s almost the only cafe open on the day of Chuseok! The coffee I was looking for was here. As of today, I make a regular reservation: I don\\'t like it. Delicious food is comfortable! But it\\'s noisy.... Mood gangster!Hahaha, a place quite famous in my neighborhood. The atmosphere was nice and the pasta was really delicious. I saw a lot of couples. The price is reasonable and it\\'s not too cheap or too sweet. It\\'s so soft that it stays in my memory for a long time. I think it\\'s a local restaurant. Wow~ I almost cried after eating carbonara with my son. The clean taste is really good... Thank you very much for opening the store in front of my house. I am really living thanks to the cafe. The taste is basic. It\\'s clean and modern. You\\'re the best. Please continue to do that. Grapefruit ice flakes are awesome!! Other drinks and dishes are full of sincerity. The price is nice~ Hongje-dong\\'s hidden attraction! Oops! Grapefruit board car+chicken quesadilla jackpot@@;. Mood gangster!Hahaha, a place quite famous in my neighborhood.

The part-timer was really nice and took good care of me, so I enjoyed watching it!! I like cartoon cafes, but I think I will come here often.^^. Part-timers I speak with a rotten look and I don\\'t have that kind of spirit even though I\\'m a service worker. Don\\'t make a sullen face when you talk to customers. If I were the boss, I\\'d be right out of this business. The book is really not real. If you touch a book, you\\'ll catch germs. It\\'s old and dirty. Not many comic books. The room is small and uncomfortable. It was nice to spend time watching cartoons. I caught a cold because it was so cold.ᅲ. There are benches, simple exercise equipment, and public restrooms. Watching the local babies come and play and digest the food they ate. But there was a seed oil right in front of me, so I ate ice cream again.. a simple and comfortable place. Even if it\\'s a little loud, he\\'s gonna hit the wall.It is not a cartoon cafe. You want quiet at the library level. If possible, don\\'t go...I\\'m stressed out because you\\'re walking around and looking at me.I hope you never go... It\\'s a garbage company that doesn\\'t cut off the five-hour plan because it\\'s Christmas, and if you\\'re going to stay for five hours, cut off for three hours and pay extra. I just feel bad after going there... A lot of new books. Good. The new books are organized neatly, especially chicken mayo.lol lol it was good that the boss was kind. The owner is kind and the coffee is delicious and the sky is so beautiful that you can see the beautiful sky at night in the low daytime. The place I want to know only. The view is good and the drink is good. No one goes. I\\'m the only one going. It\\'s the best. Cafe with good coffee. The boss was kind and the mood was so good.It would be nice to go on a date.. It\\'s the best if you go when you have a lot of free time before the show. It\\'s comfortable and I rested well. It\\'s really annoying to talk sarcastically about how a woman boss is so rude.. Air conditions, floor conditions are terrible.  Sunday\\'s women\\'s counter part-time job, no friendliness. It\\'s a very clean atmosphere I liked it. It was clean and the air in the atmosphere was good. If you have zero stars, this is the bowling alley you want to give zero stars to. The approach is so slippery that you can hit it on the ground five times in your step is taken. You have to keep asking why the bowling ball is caught, and there should be a person next to you who can fix why the fire goes out while bowling.Free parking for visiting bowling games on weekends. Why did you just find out? the best of the best. If you\\'re watching this, please train the staff. I went to the room escape in a good mood and came here because of the staff. It was the most fun place I\\'ve ever been to. I don\\'t think It\\'s just nice. Maybe it\\'s because I didn\\'t ask for a hint.ᄏLaughing while waiting, eating snacks and engineers\\' theme, if there\\'s no crazy code. The employees are unfriendly. The facilities are fine. I went early because it was a morning discount, so I can\\'t get a drink or other service. (Other time users can use it) I have to pay all the original fee and only pay in cash... I think you should have told me about the payment method and the restrictions. I agree with Mr. Impulse\\'s review. Everyone else was kind, but the employee who gave me a hint while receiving the intercom at the counter! I thought you wanted to fight because you hate me so much. The employees are so unfriendly. No basic service mind. I\\'m rather trying to fight a guest because I can\\'t treat you badly. There are a lot of good reviews of Code K, but if you promote your blog, they give you a lot of discounts, so I have no choice but to do it. Don\\'t be fooled! Go to the Gangnam branch of the Seoul Icecape Room.. nan. Badminton court, basketball court, and sports equipment are good for simple exercise.. What is it? Do you know everything? I\\'ve never seen such a shabby and shabby place like this before. I was so surprised to see why you\\'re doing this. I had so much fun by myself. Next time, I\\'m going to visit my friends Delco. I went to college and tried it with my friends. It\\'s so fun. I was worried at first, but I got addicted to it. I\\'ve been to the escape room cafe for the first time and it\\'s so much fun. Next time, I\\'m going to go to another theme room with my friend. Everyone down there? There\\'s no such thing as a device in the escape room, but only a lock open structure. It\\'s a movie theme, but just a picture.. nan. I love the sound system. The sound is the best in Hongje. If the whole door was opaque, it would have been better to sing alone. It\\'s a shame. And it\\'s three songs for 1,000 won. It\\'s more expensive than coin karaoke. But it\\'s 2 a.m. in the morning.It\\'s good to be here until 2:30. It\\'s the longest I\\'ve ever had a red cone.. Improvements are clean and consistent. It\\'s clean and nice. It\\'s perfect for children to sing. The facilities are good and the air is good on the second floor, so I think I go there often.. It\\'s the best.. I\\'m a little sad. I come here often, but I don\\'t like working with the attitude of part-timers. I have two or three teams of people who work during the day on May 22, and I have a lot of people waiting, but I don\\'t have to take my girlfriend out in the middle, so I just use my cell phone without waiting.. Aside from the game, the boss is very unfriendly. I arrived before the reservation time, and he was telling me that I was really late, that I was late, that if I didn\\'t start now, I\\'d be late, so I\\'d have to explain it roughly and start. The room actually comes out in 30 minutes. I was underdeveloped, but I had a lot of fun. This is the least interesting place I\\'ve ever been to... I heard that the automatic device is 80 percent, but it\\'s not... I don\\'t know if it\\'s because there\\'s no one working, but even if I ask for a hint, they don\\'t respond right away and I can It was even dark, so there was no problem, and there was a malfunction...  It\\'s not a place to go in anticipation of the story. It was close to money. I\\'m addicted to escape room cafes. Exodus Hongdae was the best. We\\'ve tried everything from the level of difficulty to the level of award. As if you\\'re back to your childhood at the Olympics, the game is so fun and you should try to escape the zombies. It\\'s so much fun! It was the worst room escape I\\'ve ever been to in Hongdae. The male staff explained it to me at first, and all the people I went to, including me, felt that he spoke too fast and roughly. So I couldn\\'t understand two-thirds of the explanation. The escape room cafe was an important part of the explanation, but it was so disappointing that the problem was less connected than other escape cafes, so there were many parts where it was disconnected whether it was right or what to do next. It\\'s 17,000 won even if you get a double cash discount or a good discount, but it\\'s not that cheap and I don\\'t want to recommend it. Compared to other room escape cafes that offer social discounts, it\\'s really bad.Folding. I\\'m repairing the inside. I\\'ve never been there before, but it\\'s expensive, and there\\'s no answer. Land prices. Curtain, soundproof, sanitation. In conclusion, part-timers are unfriendly.The way the part-timer talks was a bit unkind. The ceiling was connected to the next room, so it was not soundproof at all, and the air conditioning was also air-conditioned and there was only a fan. It was hard to feel the comfort of the room cafe. The tall, bang-up part-timer is so unkind.I\\'m not going again. Here you go. I\\'ll press I strongly recommend this. When I was in Gwangju, I went there often and looked it up. As expected, it was okay. I often go to the academy with a friend who studies with me on weekdays. It\\'s good to study quietly and eat delicious food without being conscious of others I recommend it. It\\'s great. Why didn\\'t you know about it? I was sitting there paying you a lot of money. ~~~~ I\\'m going to roll around in the caramel now. I went there because it\\'s my friend\\'s birthday. She likes cute things. I didn\\'t know that other people were not aware of it. I just talked with my friends. I didn\\'t know that they were in Gangnam, but I liked them more because they I\\'m going to drop by on my next friend\\'s birthday. I went to the room cafe for the first time and I didn\\'t know what it was. My boyfriend found out so I went with him. It was really comfortable. I like drinking tea. So I drank a lot. I should go again. Gangnam Café Crane sounds good. I was shopping with my friend and I was so tired that I rolled around in the cafe crane. My legs hurt because of the heels, but I took a rest and went shopping again. I didn\\'t know it was warm and comfortable in Gangnam, but it\\'s so comfortable. I\\'m rolling around~ I\\'m at a cafe crane. I went there on weekends, but it was a whole new world when I went to cafes every day. Go to Gangnam station with your boyfriend and stop by when you\\'re tired. I often go to Gangnam station because of academy these days.I used the room cafe for the first time after reading the blog review.It\\'s a room cafe where you can watch TV. It\\'s amazing. There\\'s an unlimited refill of ice cream and waffles.Couples ^^. The store is clean and cheap, so it\\'s really good to spend time. 1,000 won per hour, 5,000 won per week, 4,000 won at night.. Is this bowling?? The entrance isn\\'t from gs25 o\\'clock, but if you turn left and go to the parking lot entrance, there\\'s a stairway that goes down to the outside.  The only stairway outside the entrance is the stairs. It\\'s more expensive than anywhere else, and you\\'re done playing games and putting on your shoes, and you\\'re urging them to get out. That\\'s the best. The first floor feels like a player and a club, while the second basement level feels like rock bowling and playing. Broad and staff friendly.. If it was close to my house, I would like to go to a ramen restaurant every day. The facilities and toilets are clean and nice. I\\'d like to give you a rating of 5.5 if you feel like it. I want to come every day. Ramen restaurants will be open!!!  There\\'s also a dog cat. It\\'s too much. My favorite place is also a dog cat, so it follows people well and plays well. I like it because there are the most comic book types among comic cafes around here. I want to buy a regular ticket.. nan. This is the first time I\\'ve ever seen a place like this. The price of a weekend is 13,000 won per person. What is a self-bar?; Popcorn aloe pet drinks and all the pet bottled drinks at room temperature that are not in the refrigerator of the pet bottle. It is best not to go to places like trash for such a high price. If you didn\\'t like the self-bar at a high price, the bread will be hard and I\\'ll eat it because it\\'s old, and the popcorn is the worst waste of money.. It\\'s fun. The scenery is nice, but no Cheolbong.ᅲ. A good day to see cherry blossoms ^^ Cherry blossom fill April is really awesome. Very neat...The coin singing room, where you can pay by credit card without cash, was very clean and the facilities were satisfactory, and there was a separate smoking area. 3rd floor. nan. I like the microphone, but it\\'s too cold to sing for a long time in winter.  I wish you could heat it up.. The best. The best. The cats are so pretty that I keep thinking about them. They\\'re the best.. I was happy that the staff was kind and they recommended the cocktail that I wanted, so I enjoyed it. I\\'m willing to revisit. I thought about it because there were many kinds of cocktails, but I think I chose them well and enjoyed them! The atmosphere is nice and the bathroom is clean! I can\\'t help it. I don\\'t want to recommend it to women. It is a typical Korean man who explains cocktails without any other explanation. Cocktail descriptions are misogynistic. Cocktails are delicious. Don\\'t order chicken.It\\'s like a rock. The atmosphere of the store is exciting and it\\'s so nice. 100 points for the cocktail! I can\\'t believe there was such a thing at Jonggak.~ I like the view because it is on the 3rd floor and the store is so clean. It was my first time playing Beopong here, and I had so much fun playing darts. It\\'s got a lot of moods and cocktails. Full of thoughts to revisit!  There\\'s a lot to play with, and the atmosphere is absolutely superb. The original bar? The bar is clean, but the bathroom is dirty, and I was surprised because the bathroom is clean. Cocktails are the best I\\'ve ever had. I don\\'t know what to eat, but a place where you can play simple dart games, beer, and cocktails. It\\'s normal. It was delicious and the atmosphere was nice. It was amazing to eat cocktails that were not elsewhere. The staff will be kind and regular. There are a lot of things to play on the 3rd floor, so the view is good and the store is clean. There are various kinds of cocktails. Third floor terrace clean kind price reasonable. A place where the explanation of alcohol makes people feel bad. You can go if you want to hurt your way I went on a date with NamChini this weekend, and the atmosphere is so beautiful. I fell in love with it. I recommended a lot of things to brag about to my friends.Haha pretty!. All right. All right.. It\\'s a bit over the top, but he\\'s kind, and he takes care of this and that. It\\'s cheap because they serve snacks and drinks at the price of a regular room cafe, but the time seems to be just like a knife.. It says, \"Don\\'t touch a lot of cats and read books.\" But there are no books...  I was looking at a cute cat and asked to read a book, but I didn\\'t have any books, so I just came out with a lot of precious time calculations, and I don\\'t even have time.. This room is perfect for sexual behavior. Always use it well! I don\\'t want to... There are not many kinds of comic books... I don\\'t like it.. It\\'s good to be separated, but the real unkindness of a male part-timer. The interior was so pretty and luxurious. I think it would be good to go on a date and the spaces were all separate, so it was great for us to play among ourselves.. It\\'s the best.. Gwanak-gu Hip Hop PUB One Top O.K.. Memories. If you like board games, go and play! There\\'s a variety of games, too! It\\'s a place that reminds me of old memories. The boss is very kind and the price is good. The theme of the old game is novel and the food tastes good. I strongly recommend it.. Okay.. Microphone in every room is in a mess. Even if you lower the echo, it\\'s the worst because it\\'s buzzing. Besides, the microphone stinks badly. The room size is seriously small. Up to Gusan, Eungam, Bulgwang, Nokbeon, this neighborhood is the worst.. Children like it. The staff is kind and there are many kinds of games. I think there are some foreign employees who are not good at Korean, but it was okay because they were all kind. But the staff doesn\\'t know how to play, so they can only play games they know.Everything was good except him. The seats are spacious and the drinks taste good. It\\'s the best.. I don\\'t know if he\\'s a boss or an employee, but he\\'s incredibly unfriendly. I couldn\\'t sleep so I went there at dawn. I frowned and the atmosphere was like, \"Why did you come to watch cartoons at this hour?\" I looked around the bookshelf and asked him what book he was looking for. Tell me what I\\'m looking for instead of looking for a book. Maybe I\\'m overreacting because I\\'m afraid I\\'ll mess it up when I read a book at dawn. I was older than I was, so I endured it, but I came out in 30 minutes, wondering how hard life must be. When the boss sees an eagle, change employees, give them some more money, and pay attention to employee welfare. If you\\'re the boss, you\\'re so stressed out and if you\\'re going to work, stop. Breast-washing again because it\\'s milk. It\\'s kind of cool. Lego and the game machine.. nan. nan. With the party room atmosphere, simple meals, drinks, and board games with friends.. Mara restaurant. I modified the information. The atmosphere is good, the food is delicious, and you must be busy because it\\'s a one-person restaurant, but the boss is kind and has no drawbacks. It\\'s normal. I called around 7 p.m. 2 days ago because it was reserved 2 days before Dongpayuk, and they asked me to call them back at 1 p.m. the next day. I called you at 2:30 p.m. on the job, and you can\\'t just go shopping.Yes, and not after 1 o\\'clock, but just at 1 o\\'clock. I recommend Dongpayuk only for those who can make a reservation at 1 o\\'clock. It\\'s the best. I\\'d like to recommend the addictive four-tenthal stir-fried chicken wings, \\'Razzy~~. I was watching a movie with my friend, but I couldn\\'t concentrate because he was so chatty outside whether he was an employee or an employee friend. I keep on worrying. I don\\'t like it.. The price is higher than anywhere else.. I\\'ve been here twice. I\\'ve been here twice.Well-matched, husband who came here not long after dating boyfriend and said that he is a good match well.  I saw it from the director. A few years later, I came back with my friend. It was a good match. I wasn\\'t bad, but I was surprised because the reviews were worse than I thought. 30,000 won. Only those who want to get upset.I don\\'t know if you\\'re going to take good care of me haha if I really think I\\'m going to take a better look at you, I just lost time and money.It\\'s too easy to make money, isn\\'t?lol. lol. ^^ None of this is right... or not LOL. The staff are all sitting down, they\\'re playing board games, they\\'re louder than people, and they\\'re too dark to press the button to change, they don\\'t want to do it. The only advantage is clean, pretty design.. I enjoyed reading comic books in the cold weather. You\\'re so kind and I feel good. I go often.. Convenience facilities for the residents are well-equipped and well- It\\'s the best. It\\'s the neighborhood park behind my house. It\\'s a healing park for residents of Gocheok-dong.. Could you put me on the bowling ball?ᅮ. Kimchi fried rice is especially delicious. He has been in a bookstore since a long time ago, so he has a lot of books and I think he is kind. It\\'s nice, it\\'s wide... It\\'s a cartoon cafe where the owner is completely unfriendly... ...and the whole family can have a good weekend together. The best//~. nan. nan. nan. Drinks are expensive and tasteless. I won\\'t tell you about the game. It says you\\'ll get an extra charge for more than a minute of unfriendliness, but when I tried to pay, you didn\\'t come to the bathroom. Don\\'t be fooled by the word 1,500 won an hour.. Kind, nice to go with friends, and kind to part-timers. I visit you when I think of you because of the mascot, Welsh Corgi Muru. It\\'s not the cutest thing in this world. Cafe owner\\'s kind and accurate explanation, various games, kind part-timers.  This is a place you\\'ll keep looking for if you live close by. If you ask me how many times I\\'ve been talking about picking out a board game, I\\'ll just give it to you. Other than that, the two of us were talking, and the rules came out. The way the boss or manager talked was very unpleasant. I asked you to bring me a game of the company that I want to play, but the game company is only fun for children in a way that scolds us. If you don\\'t know, just take our recommendations.\" Eventually, he didn\\'t ask our doctor and he just brought the game and explained it to us.;; I understand the intention of making the guests play a fun game, but we clearly said that there was a game we wanted, but the attitude of ignoring it completely was ridiculous. Later, I secretly asked another employee to play the game we wanted, and we had a lot of fun, and I felt uncomfortable all the time because you treated the customers as just ignorant people who don\\'t know board games. Return visit 0%~fold. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s the best. Good window seat.. nan. It\\'s good to walk. You can only make an Internet reservation. You have to go because it\\'s close. Where I want to go with my family. I\\'ve been there so many times, but I can see that it\\'s getting more and more unmanageable....Don\\'t order Nolmuk Tteokbokki anywhere because it\\'s no good, especially cream Tteokbokki is really bad objectively. The attic downstairs is all cobwebs, so I sat in an open space, and the spiders crawling next to me...It\\'s not like I haven\\'t cleaned for a day or two, but the cushion cushion is full of smell. There are a lot of books and the staff is kind.It\\'s good to go in and rest when it\\'s hot! I went at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, but it\\'s not open. Please modify the open time information. I like the facilities and comic books, but I don\\'t want to come again because of the part-timer. When I asked the part-timer what he asked, he didn\\'t answer, and I asked him again, and he said, \"I didn\\'t feel good about it.\" Okay, it\\'s normal. Oh, that\\'s great! There are a lot of the same play forest, but it\\'s an incomparable class. Sinchon nori was not popular in Facebook for no reason...!! It seems that the Ewha Womans University branch was small and unfriendly...I\\'m touched!. nan. Let\\'s go exercise! Enjoying basketball on the weekend. I\\'m way short of goalposts.. It\\'s good to come alone and with friends. Comfortable and kind cafe coffee is delicious. Cheap and delicious. The atmosphere is nice. It\\'s the best.. nan. Why did you make it dangerous in the entrance to Seongnam Airport? All right. All right. Sunday afternoon, which had been rainy and cloudy all Friday and Saturday, finally cleared up, and walked with snacks in Han River Park. We have Han River. perfect for one\\'s career There are many things to enjoy as well as see. Photographs are essential. Han River Citizens\\' Park in Amsa-dong has a naturally piled sandbar at the end of the park. In summer, you can also enjoy Bonas! where you can play with the fine riverside sand.. nan. It\\'s the best. The staff are very kind and very good at explaining. It was so nice to sit down because it was like a cafe. I strongly recommend... Employees are kind and clean because it\\'s new. The facilities were spacious and clean. It was nice to see the staff.. The boss is so kind!! A neat and friendly cartoon cafe. Okay, pop music. Various seats. No problem, no big inconvenience, no Cartoon. I like the news and community of SNS~Things on Cartoon Cafe. It\\'s so nice here. I don\\'t feel lonely alone at a comic cafe. With the creation of this place, the comic cafes will be all over the place. lol. I went here yesterday and it was really nice!. nan. The owner of the facility Cho Eum is with the cafe on the second floor, and the cafe is good too! It\\'s on the third floor. Pink pink. Clean.. ..the venue for the Hyangwoo Sports Festival. Eastern Conference Sports Event of the Association of Power Engineers. Kindness good to be alone. I heard it was a park, so I picked up a kid. LOL. Is this a park? It\\'s a tennis court at the Cultural Center. I\\'ll give you zero stars, why do you keep asking me to choose? One star is a waste;. The staff is kind and the variety of games. It\\'s good because drinks are not mandatory and you get an additional discount if you order them. But after playing the game, my hands get sticky and dirty. It would be hard to find such a large number of board games all over the country, but they are so popular that they are full on weekdays.. nan. All right. All right.. It\\'s not good. It\\'s a video clip of https://www.facebook.com/groups/koreabartendersforum/permalink/2475057379387985/ assault, and I don\\'t think we\\'ll ever go on forever, and I hope we get legal punishment. I went to a live performance on Saturday, and after I paid for it, I looked at the receipt and they didn\\'t even tell me...Cocktails taste very different depending on the bartender. When I went that day, all the cocktails were terrible.When I first started, the one that the woman dyed her hair or someone else made it was delicious.. Heesuya Hyosun king pork cutlet Ssangmun No.1. It\\'s quiet and the atmosphere is nice.  Personally, it\\'s better because it\\'s not too big.  Read the cartoon~~^^. The boss is kind, clean, and the coffee is delicious.^^. The female part-timer was really unkind. It takes a long time to explain the bang, so four of us can\\'t play the game;; there are two people who\\'ve played it before, so I\\'ll just give them a rough explanation. Other employees were kind. Clean and new games! There\\'s a lot of people, so you finished your explanation a little . It was clean and kind. And there were many kinds of board games and the explanation was kind.. It\\'s normal.. I listened to the song and I looked it up... Is this a park or a vacant lot? You\\'re the best, Byun Baek-. I like unlimited time. Here in the multi-room around here, this is Zelgagan Cha Dan. It\\'s clean, friendly, cool, and I\\'ve been having fun. I love it. I\\'m okay here. Yum yum.. It\\'s the best. It sells beer and seats are comfortable. I think it\\'s good to stay up all night or rest. It\\'s my regular bread that dingles and relaxes every weekend.^ There are a lot of comic books, the price is very nice, and there is always good music, and news of new comics is posted on Facebook every day~ I strongly recommend 5 stars.^^*. Cute cute. I don\\'t know why the reviews are not good. I just saw them on the street, and the entrance fee was 6,000 won, which is cheaper than a regular pet cafe, and the drinks were lower, and the raccoon were all cute.You don\\'t notice me even if I stay for a long time! Thank you :) There\\'s a black cat. It\\'s normal. If the real star is right, don\\'t go. Raccoon is a cute but only cafe.. I thought you were talking in a cold bone. It\\'s a board cafe, but they won\\'t explain the game. Read the instructions and tell them to take care of themselves Where are the unlimited snacks? I just feel uncomfortable and don\\'t like it. Worst ever. I\\'ll never come again. What kind of computer doesn\\'t even work on YouTube...  Please take good care of your computer. And the snacks are too weak. I happened to go there because I needed a place to rest because I was tutoring my daughter, and it was nice to take a rest in an independent space. Pay 15,000 won for the money. That\\'s ridiculous. I know it\\'s annoying because it\\'s the weekend, but the facilities aren\\'t bad. It\\'s not particularly good, it\\'s not particularly cheap, and I really don\\'t want to go if I\\'m the owner or not. I was going to sing at karaoke, but I didn\\'t have a microphone. I asked him, and he said he couldn\\'t... Please move to another room. So I moved it. It\\'s been 14 minutes since they explained it to me.. Card, sound compliance, staff. I always go here with them. I don\\'t know why the stars are like this, but there are so many students. It\\'s quite famous for coming here.I personally recommend it because it\\'s close to the apartment and you can take four pictures of your life. I want to take a look at the facilities. The facilities are all right, LOL yeah, I don\\'t care about it are not intent. lol ... what my lack of learning what where he was planning to ruin the president of them look like anyeodwae to colored hair.Acted as feces is just a mess of a mess ... Where the customer is a slave, I will tell him to clean up soon. Don\\'t go to Albama to get real cash and have fun. I\\'m so happy today. I want to go there because the facilities are good, but I don\\'t go there because the part-timers are hostile. The sound and facilities are the best in the neighborhood, but the staff is a bit... Yeah, the way you\\'re trying to teach me.. The music is too loud.... The atmosphere is nice and cozy. It\\'s the best. The atmosphere is good and everything is good, but the music is so loud that my ears are ringing when I sit outside. The drink is delicious and the atmosphere is warm, so I like it.. A place of taste! Where peace of mind comes from. I like it all, but I want you to play some quiet music for me, for the cat. I feel so bad for cats because they\\'ll be so stressed by loud music until late at night. I don\\'t like snacks for beer. It was the first place I ran to after the exam. I really wanted to blow the recorder and hit the kkwaenggwari one day... I haven\\'t been there since it was changed to Mangaba. When I entered the classroom after vacation, I felt like I saw a friend who was playing with other kids except me. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s the best. It\\'s good to walk around: I came by chance on my way to Chungmuro Station, and if I happen to come near here, it\\'s a good place to take a walk. It is well-organized for foreigners to look around and there are many things to experience Korean culture. It\\'s under construction now, but I think it\\'ll be prettier when it\\'s finished. There were not many people during the daytime on weekdays. It\\'s good for healing when you go on weekdays.. It\\'s good that there\\'s no parking lot and no 15 minutes\\' walk from the Civic Forest Station. Parking is very inconvenient...    The Kay Hotel has paid for the donation? We transfer public land into and use it for private use it. Also, culture and arts parks are managed by taxpayers\\' money, and the use is exclusively used by The K Hotel, and parking is almost impossible for ordinary citizens.   I\\'m accusing you in the name of a citizen... ...the best. All right, maybe it\\'s because there\\'s no parking lot, but there\\'s a beautiful metasequoire road on holidays.. It\\'s good to have a card machine in each room. It\\'s closer than the first store, so I\\'ll go often when the Korona situation calms down.. It\\'s the best.. It\\'s fun. The part-timer is so unkind. I went to make a reservation. I was explaining, and I went to get money from another customer who didn\\'t make another reservation. I didn\\'t come back for a long time and asked if I read the game description book and he didn\\'t even bother me. I don\\'t think it\\'s here. I couldn\\'t solve it all, but at the end of the horror theme, the staff came and tried to release me and surprise me, but I\\'m sorry I wasn\\'t surprised. I think the staff must have felt awkward because you two were so expressionless... Way to go! When you\\'re having a mental breakdown, you let me know. So I went through a lot of hardships.It\\'s fun! I\\'m excited. It was really fun! The money seems to be unified everywhere, but the theme was well done in many ways. Good. It\\'s easy to spend time and it\\'s good. Cats are friendly and can sleep while lying down and have good cost-effectiveness. Okay.. Thank you always for your kind boss. It\\'s not spacious, but it\\'s well-equipped, clean and comfortable.. There are some famous games such as Cartan, Carcasson, and Clue, but there are not many kinds of games.  Even on weekends, \\'time unlimited\\' plus \\'free drinks\\' costs 5,000 won.. Nice receiver view, good for Picnic. Good. A good place to relax and get some fresh air.. Good. I don\\'t know how it\\'s because I haven\\'t been there when there are a lot of people, but it\\'s okay. There\\'s only one speaker in a bar about 20 pyeong, so I can\\'t deliver music at all. I\\'m looking for a blog, I\\'m here to relieve stress on exciting music, but I\\'m stressed out by listening to music that I can\\'t hear.. All right, that\\'s the best.. It\\'s not a board game cafe, it\\'s a casino game center. Most of the customers play casino games and board games. I regret it when I think of a normal board game cafe. That would be a great place to play casino games. The drink is delicious. I thought it was a board game cafe, but I was disappointed. The place where I could feel as if it were a real casino by lending me more interesting board cafe chips! Good, good, good, good, haha. Hehehehehehehehehe. I\\'m so touched by Sabis\\' mind~ Drink it as a beer service, and after three hours, I was hungry and mixed grain powder service! It\\'s the first time a house has so many services. Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun. I\\'ll go again!. I went there today and it was so nice of you to let me know! You were so kind even though there was a deadline. There are too few part-timers. unkindness. It was so much fun.Freshness of the device room! The employees are kind and I will go again next time. Kindly, boss is generous, discounting this and that. Make a lot of money and increase the number of stores. Employee service is a messI\\'m just feeling dirty. One of the people below is nice and there are a lot of new devices that are not found elsewhere. I recommend you to go to Daehak-ro Room Escape. I tried all the other places, and I should have waited for 30 minutes.. nan. Good night. It\\'s cozy, clean and... It\\'s a place where the boss is really good at managing.. It was good to have various kinds of games!! :). nan. It\\'s the best.. This is TJ machine karaoke. There are places where you can take off your shoes for 1,000 won.. 1,000 won for three songs... It\\'s not cheap, but the karaoke microphone is the worst. I can\\'t feel the echo at all, and the microphone is all over the music volume, but I can\\'t control the volume of the microphone, so I\\'m going to scream and lose my voice... The 10,000 won Bluetooth microphone at home is better.... Mike is the worst.. I want to go here again. The boss, who seems to have eaten helium gas to the fullest, greets us in a friendly and humorous way. The mat is on the seat, so it\\'s soft. The boss is so kind that I want to come back later.. All right. All right. I like it here. Take a walk with your daughter. A mountain for light exercise!. nan. Oh my gosh, I was offended by the man here too, but I guess that\\'s the way he is.~~~~~ It seemed like he thought you were an uninvited guest.~~~~~ If you want to buy snacks for dogs, please pay for them and sit down in front of your laptop~ If you\\'re so bothered by it, don\\'t go to the cafe.... I\\'ll never go again. I don\\'t know if he\\'s a president or a male employee. Don\\'t talk to customers like that. It\\'s a very aggressive business.^^. 19.5 A visiting male president, Nam alba, is blunt, unkind, expensive, and time-limited. I could get him a drink at the counter on time, but he said, \"Two or three.\" The dog is chic... ...the best. Shiba dog nerd. But Americano is 6,000 won.. Good. Good mood. Draw and drink tea. It was so good.~~:-) Perfect for reasonable price and ambience exotic dates:-). It\\'s a cafe I go to when I want to draw with my girlfriend. It\\'s a cafe I found out while surfing the Internet. I can read books, draw pictures, and even drink tea. It\\'s like killing three birds with one stone.I hope you get refreshed when you go on a gloomy and gloomy day. These days, when you crave coffee, go play alone for a while. Next time you go, you know...I\\'ll see you again. This is the place where I recently visited with my children! I went to see the reviews and I think it was good because the cafe was spacious and the facilities were clean. I didn\\'t know there was a cafe like this in Hongdae... I\\'ll stop by often. Awesome location!. It\\'s the best. I wasn\\'t sure but I searched for it. The part-timers were very kind. Maybe it\\'s changed. My boyfriend and my friends go and have fun together. There\\'s nothing like a board game cafe when you play indoors, especially Jamsil, so I recommend this place. There is no place to put in Jamsil, but it was fun to play board games after a long time and there are a lot of games. I don\\'t like it.. I shouldn\\'t have gone after seeing my own reviews... I heard the price of drinks is expensive, so I drink them as a must, and pay extra for them. It\\'s a board game cafe, and it\\'s a regular family house. Only those who want to FLEX go. Well, the room is small, but it doesn\\'t feel cozy, so it feels stuffy, and the stuff on the table doesn\\'t look very clean. There aren\\'t many games, the status is torn, or some are missing. It\\'s 3,000 won per hour and you have to order a drink separately. See, it\\'s expensive, no games, not much.. nan. It\\'s much nicer than the one next door, and the owner is kind and there are many kinds of games, it\\'s very clean and clean, and the coffee and drink are delicious. Much better than the next store. Where in Jangchungdan Park is Cheonggyecheon Bridge? Have you been to the military or not? You look different in the picture. around 1965 in the army I love it. I love it. It\\'s the best. You can go on a warm day and draw some space to feel cool with a glass of beer! It is spring.. A coin singing room where customers of a store with a distinctive management philosophy of the president are screened.. nan. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. It\\'s the best. Good. Okay.. No, it\\'s a coin karaoke, but can\\'t you use coins? Well, it\\'s my fault for not having any bills.. It\\'s clean and nice.The boss was kind and had a good time without any inconvenience.May you prosper... The boss is very kind. Love. I love it because it\\'s quiet and clean! I rested well with delicious tea on a day I didn\\'t want to be disturbed.. The most cozy place in Gupabal, where you can dinga dinga. It\\'s good that there are no people. It\\'s not cheap, but it\\'s similar to other cartoon cafes! I\\'ve been to Lotte Mall often and bought a fixed-rate ticket, which is really nice. How can preschoolers and 18-year-olds get the same amount? Did you know that the book cafe opened in Starfield? Think about it.. There are a lot of fun and diverse board games and it\\'s great! I had a lot of fun! I think I\\'ll only go to Gangnam room cafe here!!!. The cattle garden in the city center...Hidden trail...The best place..... It was clean and nice on the weekend!  Chicken mayo is delicious! I recommend going on weekdays. There are too many people on weekends. It\\'s the best. I like it because it\\'s clean. And chocolate latte and chicken mayo are really delicious. It\\'s hard to go to a cafe in the back of this street. You can park here. I found it and it\\'s too much. Going out to a cafe with my girlfriend is delicious.~~~~. It\\'s normal. It was the cleanest cartoon cafe I\\'ve ever been to. I enjoyed watching it comfortably and funly. nan. Older people, dirty because they have a lot of them.'"
